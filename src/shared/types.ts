 * `mergeMethods` reuses {@link GitHubPullMergeMethod} ("merge"|"squash"|"rebase")
 * as the neutral merge-strategy vocabulary:
 * - GitHub: merge, squash, rebase (all three, unchanged).
 * - GitLab: merge, squash (GitLab has no rebase-as-a-merge-strategy option —
 *   its "rebase" action rewrites the branch before merging, it isn't a merge
 *   strategy choice like GitHub's).
 * - Bitbucket: merge, squash, rebase — Bitbucket's three `merge_strategy`
 *   values are `merge_commit` / `squash` / `fast_forward`. There is no
 *   fast-forward entry in {@link GitHubPullMergeMethod}, so `fast_forward`
 *   (a linear, no-merge-commit history — the same end result GitHub's
 *   "rebase and merge" produces) is mapped to `"rebase"` here; the adapter
 *   (Wave 2/T3, `src/bun/bitbucket.ts`) is responsible for translating
 *   `"rebase"` back to `merge_strategy: "fast_forward"` on the wire.
