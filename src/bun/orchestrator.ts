 * Anything else (cancelled or hard-failure): the child moves to `blocked`
 * — never `ready`, which is what the ordinary cancelled-run treatment
 * would do (looks like "nothing to see here, click Run") and would be
 * actively misleading for a child cancelled because a SIBLING failed and

 *     branch (mergeBranch on a branch with no new commits reports "already
 *     up to date" as success, which would wrongly mark the subtask merged
 *     and unblock its dependents). Restarting the child (Run) is the
 *     explicit way to hand its work back to the pipeline.
 *   - Boot-flake retry (RC-1): a hard failure whose run produced ZERO agent
 *     output (no assistant/tool_use event — claude died before its first
 *     token, e.g. the JSONL-discovery timeout) gets ONE automatic respawn
 *     before the failure escalates to the build-abort cascade. A boot

/**
 * Advance (or block) a pipeline task once its current stage's terminal run
 * has resolved. Called from `attachDoneHandler` in place of the plain
 * `nextColumn` ternary whenever `task.pipelineStage != null`. No-ops if the
 * task vanished, isn't a pipeline task, or `task.runId !== runId` (a
 * superseded run) — callers already guard on the latter via `isTerminalRun`
 * before invoking this, but it's re-checked here since this function can
 * also be reached from `maybeReleaseHeldTask`'s release path.
 *
 * A hard failure or cancellation always lands on `blocked` with
 * `pipelineStage` left exactly where it was, so a human sees precisely
 * where the run died and can manually re-`startTask` the same stage to
 * retry. Everything else is per-stage:
 *   - specify success: requires SPEC.md to exist → advance to clarify.
 *   - clarify success: requires SPEC.md still present → advance to planning.
 *   - planning success: requires PLAN.md to exist → advance to plan-review.
 *   - plan-review: parses the Critic's verdict. approve → planApproved=true,
 *     advance to decompose (or straight to ready if implementationApproved
 *     was already true from an earlier pass). revise → bump the shared
 *     revision counter; over cap → blocked; under cap → back to planning
 *     with the reason folded into pipelineFeedback.
 *   - decompose success: not verdict-bearing — requires TASKS.json to exist
 *     AND parse/validate, then runs the inline analyze step (AC coverage
 *     check, zero agent turns). Coverage ok → fresh entry into building via
 *     tickBuild. Gap found → bounce to decompose (same revision cap).
 *   - analyze: handled inline inside the "decompose" case; never has its own
 *     terminal run — this switch arm is a safety no-op.
 *   - building success: not verdict-bearing, straight to code-review. This
 *     is the BOUNCE-entry path only (a plain single-agent fixup turn) —
 *     the fresh-entry path is handled entirely in the "decompose" case above.
 *   - code-review: parses the Code Reviewer's verdict (same approve/revise
 *     shape plan-review uses, reviewing the merged diff and AC checklist).
 *     approve → straight to testing. revise → same cap arithmetic,
 *     bounce target is building (plain fixup, no re-decomposition).
 *   - testing: same verdict shape. pass → implementationApproved=true,
 *     straight to ready (planApproved is true by construction). fail → same
 *     cap arithmetic, bounce target is building (not planning).
 *
 * The `startTask` call for the next stage is fired-and-forgotten
 * (`void ...catch(...)`), never awaited — it must not block the caller's
 * own `emit`/`emitGlobal`/`drainCodexQueue`/`drainGeminiQueue` tail calls,
 * matching the existing "must never derail run settlement" treatment
 * `pumpWatcherForHoldCheck` already gets a few lines up in
 * `attachDoneHandler`. A `startTask` failure (harness unavailable, etc.)
 * has no other path to the user, so it's caught here and landed on
 * `blocked` itself.

 *     slot via `sendTurn`). When a turn is already in flight, the message is

 *     keeps at most one in-flight run per task so claude coalescing queued
 *     messages can't strand surplus run rows in `running`. See
 *     `sendTurnInExistingSession`.
 *
 *   • codex: each follow-up is queued and spawned as its own `codex exec
 *     resume <thread_id>` turn once the active turn resolves — codex `exec`
 *     is a one-shot process, not a REPL, so there's no live stdin to write
 *     to mid-turn. See `sendCodexTurn`/`drainCodexQueue`.
 *
 *   • gemini: same queue-and-resume shape as codex (`sendGeminiTurn`/
 *     `drainGeminiQueue`), spawning `gemini --resume <session-id>` for each
 *     queued follow-up — gemini's CLI is one-shot per turn too.
 *
 * Archived / detached-worktree restore: a message to an archived task
 * auto-unarchives it (sending is an unambiguous signal of continued
 * interest), and if the task's worktree was detached (by archive) or is
 * otherwise missing on disk, it's rematerialized via `prepareWorkdir` before
 * dispatch — same deterministic path, branch, and history, so the resumed
 * turn lands in the same place the agent left off. A hard restore failure
 * (e.g. the branch was deleted or checked out elsewhere) is surfaced as a

/**
 * Factory installed via `setContinuationRunFactory` (module init, above).
 * claude-tmux's `dispatchLine` calls this when a genuinely-new content line
 * arrives on a task's session with no turn in flight and nothing queued to
 * receive it — the case a post-`end_turn` background-task auto-continuation
 * produces (claude legitimately resolved the visible turn, then kept talking
 * once the delegated work finished). Mirrors the idle branch of
 * `sendTurnInExistingSession` above (run-row insert with an inherited
 * `claudeSessionId`, column pull-back to `running`, chunk handler, active-run
 * registration) minus the `sendTurn`/keystroke-paste step — claude is already
 * mid-response, so there's no prompt to send, only a new run row to listen
 * with.
 *
 * Returns `null` for a task the caller can't safely adopt a run for, which
 * falls back to claude-tmux's pre-existing `lastChunk` routing:
 *   - the synthetic `"__rebuild__"` taskId `rebuildEventsFromJsonl` uses for
 *     its local, DB-detached synthetic SessionState — that id can never
 *     resolve to a real task row via `tasks.get` either, but the check is
 *     spelled out explicitly so it's visible here (and testable) rather than
 *     relying on that incidental fact alone;
 *   - an unknown task (deleted out from under a live session); or
 *   - an archived task (no new run should reopen the card).
 *   - a non-claude-code task: continuations are a claude-JSONL concept (a
 *     background-task auto-continuation observed via `dispatchLine`'s tail of
 *     the session's own JSONL); codex is one-shot per turn and has no
 *     equivalent notion of "kept talking after end_turn", so there's nothing
 *     to adopt a run for. Only claude-tmux's `dispatchLine` calls this
 *     factory today, so this is defense in depth rather than a live path.

 * falls back to `spawnResumedSession` (`claude --resume <id>`) whenever
 * `hasSessionState` is false, so this is invisible to the user beyond a
 * slightly slower first reply.
 *
 * Candidates come ONLY from this instance's own DB — this must never
 * enumerate-and-kill tmux sessions (the shared-socket rule documented on
 * `reconcileOrphans` above applies here identically: a blind sweep would
 * reap a sibling agetor instance's or a `bun test` run's sessions). Probing
 * a specific candidate task id we already own (`probeSessionActivity`,
 * `sessionIdleInfo`) is fine — that's a keyed lookup, not a sweep. Codex and
 * gemini are never candidates: their sessions are one-shot per turn and
 * self-dispose (`codex-tmux.ts`, `gemini-tmux.ts`), so there's nothing to
 * reap.
 *
 * Two performance properties keep a sweep from becoming a synchronous burst
 * that stalls the main process for the duration of the scan (previously: N
 * non-archived claude tasks × ~5 DB queries + a blocking tmux probe each, all
 * in one event-loop turn):
 *  - **Cheap pre-filter.** `candidateIds` is derived entirely from the rows
 *    `tasks.list()` already fetched (no per-candidate `tasks.get` yet) and
 *    excludes any task that plainly can't own a session: archived, non-claude,
 *    or — the key trim — neither holding in-memory `SessionState` nor ever
 *    having started a run (`hasSessionState(t.id) || t.runId != null`). A
 *    never-started task fails both and drops out before it costs anything
 *    more than an array filter.
 *  - **Per-candidate yield.** `await Bun.sleep(0)` at the top of every loop
 *    iteration hands control back to the event loop between candidates, so
 *    HTTP requests, SSE pushes, and session tailers keep running throughout a
 *    sweep instead of queuing up behind it. This is what makes the pre-kill
 *    re-check below load-bearing rather than defensive-only: with real
 *    yields between iterations, a message that lands mid-sweep (starts a
 *    turn, opens a pending interaction) MUST be caught by a guard re-read
 *    immediately before the kill, not just the one the loop started with.
 *
 * Every guard is re-checked against a freshly-read task row immediately
 * before the kill, not from the snapshot the loop started with. Guard work
 * itself is hoisted to avoid redundant reads: `isReapable` takes the already
 * -fetched `Task` row and calls the pure `isTaskHeldByBackgroundAgents(task)`
 * predicate directly rather than the taskId-keyed `isHeldByBackgroundAgents`
 * wrapper, which would otherwise re-fetch the same row internally.
 *
