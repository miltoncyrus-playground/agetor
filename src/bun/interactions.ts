 * In-process registry for user interactions an agent needs to drive through
 * agetor's UI: scraper-sourced AskUserQuestion / ExitPlanMode modals,
 * unstructured tmux-pane prompts, and fx's ACP `session/request_permission`
 * calls. Each follows the same shape — a localhost POST, a scraper-driven
 * send-keys sequence, or a driver awaiting an RPC reply — held open via a
 * Promise (or a no-op resolve, for the scraper-sourced kinds) until the user
 * answers.
 *
 * Everything here is in-memory. Pending interactions don't survive an agetor
 * restart, by design: on boot we reattach or orphan `agetor-*` tmux sessions
 * (we never blind-kill), so the children waiting on these promises are
 * re-derived from the live pane rather than persisted. fx has no reattach
 * path at all (`fx-acp.ts` is a plain piped-stdio child, not tmux-hosted) —
 * a restart simply kills the driver and its pending card dies with it, same
 * in-memory-only discipline, just with no live process left to re-derive
 * anything from.
 *
 * Settlement single-source-of-truth: for the two kinds with a real awaiter
 * (`tmux_prompt`, `fx_permission`), exactly one of three paths resolves any
 * given entry — the user's answer via its HTTP route, `cancelPendingForTask`
 * (Stop / delete), or (for fx) the driver's own cancel/teardown calling
 * `answerFxPermission` directly instead of ever replying to the RPC itself.
 * Whichever gets there first deletes the map entry, so the other two become
 * no-ops (`answer*` returns `false` / the id is already gone) — no request
 * is ever answered twice.
