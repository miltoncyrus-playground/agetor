/**
 * Bitbucket Cloud (api.bitbucket.org, REST 2.0) adapter
 * (docs/plans/multi-provider-git-modal.md, T3).
 *
 * Mirrors `src/bun/github.ts`'s shape as closely as the two APIs allow, so the
 * facade (`git-host.ts`, T4) can dispatch to whichever provider a repo
 * resolves to without special-casing return shapes: every exported function
 * here returns the SAME shared `GitHub*` wire types as its github.ts
 * counterpart (`{ok:true} & X | {ok:false;error}`), just normalized from
 * Bitbucket's JSON instead of GitHub's. `src/bun/gitlab.ts` is the sibling
 * adapter for GitLab (owned by a different task/agent in this wave).
 *
 * Key shape difference from github.ts: every github.ts function takes a
 * `dir` and resolves the repo (and does local git work like reading the
 * current branch) itself via `repoForDir`. This adapter instead takes an
 * already-resolved `repo: ProviderRepoInfo` (the facade resolves it once via
 * `providerRepoForDir`, T1) — this module does no local git/filesystem work
 * at all, only Bitbucket HTTP calls. The one place that matters is
 * `getBitbucketPullDefaults`: unlike `getGitHubPullDefaults`, it cannot read
 * the local checkout's current branch (no `dir`), so `head` is always `""`
 * here — the facade is expected to fill it in from local git the same way
 * for every provider, since "current branch" is a local-checkout concept,
 * not a provider concept.
 *
 * Bitbucket API facts this file leans on (see plan §2/§3 and Bitbucket's own
 * docs):
 *  - Base URL `https://api.bitbucket.org`; a repo is addressed as
 *    `/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}` — `owner`/`name` on
 *    `ProviderRepoInfo` map to workspace/repo_slug respectively.
 *  - Auth is Basic (email + API token) or Bearer (workspace/repo access
 *    token) — `bitbucketCreds` (git-provider.ts) resolves which.
 *  - List responses page as `{values, next, page, pagelen, size}`; `next` is
 *    an absolute URL to the following page — this module's `fetchBitbucket`
 *    passes an absolute URL straight through instead of re-prefixing it.
 *  - Bitbucket Query Language (`q=`) expresses server-side filters; multiple
 *    clauses combine with ` AND `. There is no Bitbucket equivalent of
 *    GitHub labels, so `labels` is accepted (for interface parity with
 *    call sites shared across providers) but always ignored.
 *
 * Leaf module: does not import `db.ts`, `server.ts`, or `github.ts`. May
 * import from `git-provider.ts`, `git-diff.ts`, and `../shared/types.ts`.

/**
 * Guards every exported entry point below against a Bitbucket Server / Data
 * Center remote. This adapter (like `BITBUCKET_API_BASE` above) is Bitbucket
 * *Cloud*-only by construction: Server/DC speaks a structurally different
 * REST API (`/rest/api/1.0`, different resource shapes for PRs, issues,
 * comments, diffs, …) — there is no base-URL swap that makes this module
 * work against it, unlike GitLab's self-hosted case (which is the *same*
 * `/api/v4` shape at a different host). Without this guard, a repo whose
 * remote resolves to a Server/DC host would silently keep hitting the
 * hardcoded `api.bitbucket.org` and come back with a misleading "repo not
 * found" 404 instead of an actionable "wrong product" error — exactly
 * today's failure mode.
 *
 * `apiHostForRemote` (git-provider.ts) resolves `repo.remoteHost` through
 * `~/.ssh/config` the same way `gitlabHost`/`gitlabApiBase` do in gitlab.ts:
 * `bitbucket.org` itself short-circuits to itself, and an alias whose
 * `HostName` is `bitbucket.org` (or one of Bitbucket's alternate SSH
 * hostnames, `altssh.bitbucket.org`/`ssh.bitbucket.org`) also resolves to
 * `bitbucket.org` — both pass. It's sync, never throws, and caches its own
 * resolution per host, so calling this at the top of every entry point below
 * costs nothing beyond the first `ssh -G` shellout for a given remote host.
 *
 * This function only ever *rejects* on positive evidence of a distinct,
 * dotted Server/DC domain — it fails open whenever ssh can't tell us
 * anything useful:
 *  - Resolved host is `bitbucket.org` → allow.
 *  - Resolved host has no dot at all (e.g. a bare alias like
 *    `bitbucket-work` with no matching `~/.ssh/config` entry) → allow. A
 *    dotless string can never be a Server/DC FQDN, so this is ssh actively
 *    telling us nothing, not evidence of a different product. The request
 *    proceeds to `api.bitbucket.org` keyed by the alias's own credentials —
 *    the same multi-identity behavior this module has always supported.
 *  - Resolved host is a dotted domain other than `bitbucket.org` → reject.
 *    ssh either actively redirected the raw remote host elsewhere (a real
 *    alias-to-Server/DC mapping) or simply echoed the raw host back
 *    unchanged (no `~/.ssh/config` entry at all) — either way this is
 *    positive evidence of a distinct domain, so the request is rejected
 *    before any network call, with a hint to add a `HostName bitbucket.org`
 *    entry when the echoed-back case is actually a not-yet-configured cloud
 *    alias.
 *
 * Host comparisons are case-insensitive (the resolved host is lowercased
 * before every comparison) as a defensive measure against a future
 * `ProviderRepoInfo` producer that doesn't already lowercase.
 *
 * Returns `null` (no error — proceed) on either allow path above; otherwise
 * the rejection message every call site returns verbatim in its own error
 * shape, before making any network call.
 *
 * Also called directly by `src/bun/clone.ts`'s `resolveCloneRepo`, which
 * needs this exact Server/DC-rejection rule for a pasted clone URL before
 * this adapter is ever reached.

 *  treatment. An *authenticated* 403 (`hadCreds === true`) usually means

 *  blocking a merge, a permission the credential's account genuinely lacks, a
 *  rate limit) — a real, specific error like that must stay front and center,

 *  and still carries the `Settings → ${GIT_HOST_TOKENS_SECTION}` marker
 *  phrase so the webview's credential-error panel renders for this case too.
 *  The underlying `message` is always preserved in the enriched text so a
 *  real, specific API error is never discarded. `hadCreds` (was a credential
 *  configured for this host at all, regardless of whether it worked?) picks
 *  between "add a credential" and "the configured credential can't access
 *  it" for 404 — the latter also calls out Bitbucket's 2026-06-09

 * Fetches the raw bytes of a single file from one side (old/new) of a

 *
 * - `side: "new"` reads the file at `source.commit.hash`, from the *source*
 *   repository (a fork for a cross-repo PR). If the source repository's
 *   `full_name` is missing/unparseable — the fork was deleted, or the API
 *   simply omitted it — this returns 404 rather than silently falling back to
 *   the destination repo: the destination almost certainly does not contain
 *   the file at the fork-only commit, so a silent fallback would either 404
 *   anyway or, worse, return the *wrong* file's bytes under the right path.
 * - `side: "old"` reads the file at the PR's merge-base commit, resolved via
 *   Bitbucket Cloud's documented merge-base endpoint
 *   (`resolveBitbucketMergeBase`, `GET .../merge-base/{sourceSha}..{destSha}`
 *   → `{hash}`). When the resolver fails (network error, non-2xx, or a
 *   missing/unparseable `hash` — including the cross-repo case where the
 *   destination repo doesn't share history with a since-diverged fork), this
 *   falls back to `destination.commit.hash` — an **approximation** that
 *   drifts if the destination branch has moved (and touched the same file)
 *   since the PR diverged from it, the same "approximated" tone this module
 *   already uses for `mergedAt`/`closedAt`. The old side is read from the
 *   *destination* repository either way (`?? repo` fallback is fine here —
 *   destination is the correct default when `destRepoFullName` is missing).
 *
 * Bytes come from the Source API (`GET .../src/{ref}/{path}`), which returns
 * raw file content directly (no base64 envelope). Size is checked twice: from
 * `content-length` before reading the body (cheap rejection of an obviously
 * too-large file), and again against the actual byte count after
 * `arrayBuffer()` (Bitbucket can send a chunked response with no
 * `content-length`) — same double-guard as `getGitHubPullBlob`, against
 * `MAX_BLOB_PREVIEW_BYTES` (not `BITBUCKET_DIFF_BODY_CAP_BYTES`, which bounds
 * the unified diff text, a different budget from a single file's bytes).
 *
 * On the "old" side, a resolved (and possibly cached) merge base is never
 * trusted blindly: if the `/src/{ref}/{path}` fetch 404s with `ref` set to a
 * resolver-supplied sha (not `destSha`), the merge-base cache entry for this
 * sha pair is evicted and the fetch is retried exactly once against
 * `destSha` before surfacing a 404 to the caller. This keeps a stale or
 * simply-wrong cached/resolved merge base from permanently breaking every
 * old-side preview of a PR — a subsequent request re-resolves from scratch.
 *
 * No short-circuit on missing credentials: like every other read in this
 * module (`getBitbucketPullDiff`, `getBitbucketPullChecks`, …), a public
