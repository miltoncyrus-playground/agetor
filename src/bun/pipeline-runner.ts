/**
 * The pipeline runner (T3, `docs/plans/pipelines.md` §3/§4). Turns a
 * {@link Pipeline} template into a running, hidden graph of **step tasks**
 * sharing the pipeline task's (the "parent"'s) worktree: `startPipelineRun`
 * launches the graph's start step, a `subscribeGlobal` listener registered
 * by `initPipelineRunner` watches every step task's settle/column events and
 * advances the graph — parsing each step's `<handoff>` (`src/shared/
 * pipeline.ts`), resolving fan-out/fan-in per the graph's edges, and either
 * launching the next step(s), recording the run done, or blocking with a
 * reason a human (or a retry) can act on. `advancePipeline`/
 * `retryPipelineStep`/`cancelPipelineRun` are the three manual interventions
 * `server.ts`'s routes expose; `cascadePipelineDelete`/`cascadePipelineArchive`
 * back `orchestrator.ts`'s `deleteTask`/`archiveTask` cascades (D1/D9);
 * `reconcilePipelineRuns` is the boot-time (or test-time) self-heal for a
 * step settle the runner's listener missed entirely (M16).
 *
 * This module and `orchestrator.ts` reference each other's exports (the
 * runner needs `subscribeGlobal`/`startTask`/`cancelRun`/`deleteTask`/
 * `archiveTask`/`defaultEffortFor`/`isTaskRunLive`/`pipelineUpdateColumn`;
 * `orchestrator.ts`'s `startTaskInner`/`deleteTask`/`archiveTask`/
 * `createTask` need `startPipelineRun`/`cascadePipelineDelete`/
 * `cascadePipelineArchive`/`withPipelineLock`/`initialPipelineRunState`) — a
 * static import cycle, but a safe one: every cross-reference on both sides
 * is used inside a function body, never at module top-level, so by the time
 * either side's code actually runs both modules have finished evaluating.
 * `initPipelineRunner` itself is never auto-invoked at module load (unlike,
 * say, `wireInteractionBroadcast()` in orchestrator.ts) — `index.ts`/
 * `headless.ts` call it explicitly, once, right before `reconcileOrphans()`.

 *

 *  - Already reminded once for this execution (`historyEntry.reminder` set,
 *    for ANY reason — one reminder max per execution) blocks immediately,
 *    ahead of every other check below: there's nothing left to attempt.
 *  - Major 1: re-reads the parent AND the step task fresh — the copies

 *    an `archiveTask`/delete cascade races in through this exact same
 *    per-parent lock (`archiveTask` sets `archivedAt` on the parent row
 *    BEFORE it ever acquires the lock, per `persist`'s "m8" doc). A
 *    tombstoned/missing/archived parent, or an archived step task, must
 *    never reach `sendInput` — it falls straight to the ordinary block.
 *  - Major 2: `isDeliberateWholeRunStop` — a step that finished with a bad
 *    handoff while the whole run is being torn down (`cancelPipelineRun`,
 *    or every other live sibling already mid-cancellation) must not have
 *    the reminder revive the run back into `running`.
 *  - Otherwise: hand the send back to the caller. Medium 3 — the reminder
 *    is recorded onto `historyEntry.reminder` ONLY when `sendInput` reports
 *    `delivered: true` (see `deliverHandoffReminder`); a failed/withheld
 *    send records NOTHING there, so the NEXT settle may still try once, and
 *    folds the failure reason into the ordinary block's message instead.
