/**
 * Which tmux server socket to talk to, or `null` for tmux's own default
 * socket (`/tmp/tmux-<uid>/default`).
 *
 * This exists because of a real incident: `bun test` (including a zombie
 * agent dogfooding agetor on itself) ran on the user's shared default tmux
 * socket, and a test that deletes `AGETOR_TMUX_BIN` to exercise the raw-PATH
 * fallback ended up issuing `new-session`/`kill-session` churn against the
 * *production* server — which died mid-run and took every live agent
 * session on it down with it. Socket isolation makes the whole test suite
 * structurally unable to reach the production socket, regardless of which
 * test forgets to scope itself.
 *
 * The production branch (below) ALSO gets its own dedicated socket, derived
 * from the data dir, rather than tmux's shared default socket — two reasons:
 * (1) it means agetor always *owns* (and, per `ensureDisclaimedServer()`
 * below, starts) its own tmux server rather than sometimes attaching to a
 * server some other process on the machine already started undisclaimed,
 * which is what makes the disclaim-at-server-start trick reliably cover
 * every session agetor hosts; (2) it isolates agetor's sessions from the
 * user's own terminal tmux usage on the same machine. One-time upgrade
 * cost: sessions still running on the OLD shared default socket at upgrade
 * time become unreachable from the new socket — handled non-destructively
 * by the existing `orphaned` -> `ready` boot reconciliation path (they're
 * just dead sessions from the new socket's point of view, same as a crash).
 *
 * Precedence, read at CALL time (no module-level caching) so tests can
 * flip `AGETOR_TMUX_SOCKET`/`NODE_ENV` between cases without a restart:
 *   1. `AGETOR_TMUX_SOCKET` env override — explicit test/power-user escape
 *      hatch. The literal value `"default"` means "force tmux's own default
 *      socket even under test", so a test that genuinely needs the real
 *      socket (or a developer debugging against it) isn't stuck.
 *   2. `NODE_ENV === "test"` (bun test sets this) → `"agetor-test"` — the
 *      safety net. Catches every test file, including ones that never
 *      import this module directly, as long as they route through the
 *      `tmux()` runner in claude-tmux.ts.
 *   3. Otherwise, a per-instance socket derived from `dataDir` (e.g.
 *      `"agetor"` for the packaged app, `"agetor-dev"` under `bun run dev`).
