/**
 * fx-only login probe: `fx status --json` is spike-verified to run
 * unauthenticated with zero filesystem writes, so it's safe to run on every
 * status check (unlike a probe that might trigger a login flow or write
 * config). Strictly FAIL-OPEN — returns `{ loggedIn: null, authHelp: null }`
 * for anything it can't confidently parse, never a false "logged out":
 *   - the test/e2e stub binaries (`AGETOR_FX_BIN` overrides) don't implement
 *     `status --json` at all and will exit non-zero / print nothing, which
 *     must never be mistaken for "missing" and block a run;
 *   - a future fx renaming or dropping the `auth` field must degrade to
 *     "unknown", not "logged out" — see A1 in the plan doc: the authenticated
 *     value of `auth` is unverified, only `"missing"` is confirmed.
 * Two combinations are treated as a positive "logged out" signal; every other
 * parseable value — including any absent or non-boolean field along the way —
 * is treated as logged in, exactly as before:
 *   - `auth === "missing"` (from a real fx binary that answered the probe);
 *   - `auth !== "missing"` but `auth_expired === true` (strict boolean) AND
 *     `auth_refreshable === false` (strict boolean) — a 0.0.7+ (unchanged in
 *     0.0.8) expired, non-refreshable login. Real `fx acp` would fail this at
 *     `initialize` with fx's own raw -32600 anyway (see fx-acp.ts's
 *     `RpcError.rawMessage` passthrough for that same code), so a friendly
 *     pre-flight refusal here is strictly better than letting the run fail
 *     unexplained later. An expired login that's still refreshable
 *     (`auth_refreshable` anything but strict `false` — absent, non-boolean,
 *     or `true`) stays fail-open on purpose: fx may silently refresh the
 *     token on real use (`fx acp`), and this passive probe never attempts a
 *     refresh, so it can't prove the login is actually dead — blocking here
 *     would be a false "logged out" for a session fx would happily revive.
 *
 * This expired-login gate is exempt entirely when `auth` is one of the
 * env-key values (`"AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY"` / `"VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN"`) — those
 * `auth` values mean the ACTIVE auth mechanism is the env key, not a stored
 * login, so a stale *stored* login must never refuse a run that would
 * authenticate via the key. Whether fx even emits `auth_expired` alongside
 * env-key auth is unobserved (these fields were only ever seen on real `fx
 * login` accounts, never on an env-key-authenticated probe), and the gate
 * deliberately exempts them anyway so the long-standing guarantee "a
 * key-authenticated user is never gated out here" stays literally true. The
 * expired-login gate thus applies only to login-style `auth` values (e.g.
 * `"fx login"`, provider subscription logins like `"fx login codex"`).
 *
 * Empirically verified auth values (real fx binary, v0.0.6 and v0.0.7 —
 * `HOME` pointed at an empty dir so no ambient credentials leak in): no
 * credentials at all → `auth:"missing"` + `auth_help`; `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
 * set → `auth:"AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY"`; `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` set → `auth:
 * "VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN"` — i.e. env-var auth IS reflected in the probe's
 * output, and since this probe runs with the same `harnessEnv(harness)` a
 * real spawn uses, a key-authenticated user is never gated out here. The
 * probe writes no files.
 *
 * 0.0.7 additions (verified 2026-08-31 against a live fx 0.0.7 binary, build
 * cef08aa0f178, real logged-in account): `status --json` gained an
 * always-present `mcp:{connection_check,servers,configuration_issues,
 * inspection_error}` object and `mcp_config_warning` — both purely additive
 * and ignored here by construction (only `auth`, `auth_help`, `auth_expired`,
 * `auth_refreshable` are read, matching every JSON-parsing probe's
 * unknown-fields-are-fine contract) — plus `auth_expired`, `auth_refreshable`,
 * and `team` appearing on real login accounts. Observed live on one such
 * account with an expired session: `auth:"fx login"`, `auth_expired:true`,
 * `auth_refreshable:true`, `team` present — i.e. real accounts do exercise
 * the refreshable branch above, and in that state passive probes (this one
 * included) see the unauthenticated model catalog, which is a separate,
 * already-fail-open concern (`discoverFx`), not this gate's job.
 *
 * Re-verified against fx 0.0.8 (binary probe, 2026-09-08, build_revision
 * 43c11dcc34a9): the `status --json` builder is byte-identical to 0.0.7
 * (`output_contracts.zig`), so nothing above changes. Confirmed facts, not
 * schema changes: `auth_expired` is present in the payload only when `true`
 * (absent — not `false` — on a fresh/non-expired probe) and
 * `mcp_config_warning` only when there's an actual warning, so their absence
 * on a given probe is normal, not evidence of a dropped field. There's a new
 * possible `auth` value, `"host managed"` (a space, not a hyphen), emitted
 * when the fx process runs under `FX_AUTH_MODE=host-managed` (an
 * embedding-host feature) — agetor never sets that var, and if it were ever
 * seen here the existing "every other parseable value ⇒ loggedIn:true"
 * fallthrough already handles it correctly: the embedding host owns
 * credentials in that mode, so there's nothing for this gate to check. The
 * payload carries `build_revision` (0.0.8 measured: `"43c11dcc34a9"`) but no
 * top-level `version` field. The other always-present fields — `kind`,
 * `update_channel`, `build_channel`, `permission_mode`, `workspace`,
 * `history_turns`, `session_permission_grants`, `agent_step_limit`, and the
 * `mcp{connection_check,servers,configuration_issues,inspection_error}`
 * object — are, as before, ignored here by construction.
