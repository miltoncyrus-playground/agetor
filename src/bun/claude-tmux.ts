 *     (inline) renderer regardless of the user's saved `tui` setting. Claude
 *     Code v2.1.89+ added an opt-in "Fullscreen rendering" mode (`/tui

 *     tmux pane (its own UI renders the JSONL stream), so fullscreen's
 *     flicker / memory / mouse wins are irrelevant here. Per the docs this var
 *     takes precedence over `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER` and the `tui` setting.
 *     Docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fullscreen

 * because the scraper catches a wider set of modals than permission
 * prompts — the model picker and `/login` open with the cursor on the
 * *current* value, not necessarily option 1.
 *
 * Y/N modals: pass `cursorIndex` as undefined — the function falls back
 * to sending the literal `y`/`n` keystroke, which claude's confirm
 * helper handles directly.
 *
 * Each arrow press is its own `send-keys` invocation with a small sleep
 * between them. A bursted `Down Down Enter` lands as one read on
 * claude's stdin and the trailing Enter can be consumed before the
 * second Down propagates through the Ink reducer — the same race the
 * original `digit + Enter` split was working around.
 *
 * NOT a chat message: we deliberately bypass the `load-buffer +
 * paste-buffer` flow `pastePrompt` uses, because that path delivers the
 * text into claude's input buffer to become the next prompt. The modal
 * wants direct keypresses, not a queued message.
 *
 * Returns true on apparent success (every tmux command exited 0).
 * Silently returns false when no session is registered, when the target
 * key isn't present in the supplied choices, or when the session is
 * disposed mid-body (a `dropSession` + respawn during the inter-
 * keystroke gap would otherwise leak the trailing Enter into the fresh
 * pane as a stray confirmation).
 *
 * Latency: serialized behind any in-flight tmux op for the same task
 * (paste-prompts included), so a click that lands while a `/model X`
 * settle window is still elapsing waits up to `slashCommandSettleMs`
 * (default 700ms) before the first keystroke goes out. The server route
 * at `server.ts:1420` awaits this Promise, so the modal-click HTTP

 *    `"review"` sighting here means the just-sent confirm was swallowed by
 *    Ink's repaint and must be resent, bounded by `ASK_VERIFY_MAX_RESENDS`
 *    so a genuinely stuck review screen fails instead of looping forever.
 *    (A singleFlat plan never renders a review screen, so `confirmSent`
 *    stays false there; if one ever appeared anyway, the step would send —
 *    not resend — the confirm, which is the robust choice.)
 *

 * phase or resend count — the only success case. `"question"` is always
 * `"wait"`: mid-drive it's normal progress toward the review screen, and

 *     singleFlat shape, which has no review screen and no confirm to gate —
 *     the full key list is sent here and phase 2 below just verifies.)
 *  2. When `confirmsReview`, polls the pane (`ASK_REVIEW_POLL_MS` /
 *     `ASK_REVIEW_POLL_ATTEMPTS`) until the review screen is actually
 *     rendered, then sends the confirm Enter. A mis-drive that never reaches
 *     the review screen within the window is not force-confirmed with a
 *     blind Enter — it falls through to verification, which will time out.
 *  3. Always verifies (including singleFlat): polls
 *     (`ASK_VERIFY_POLL_MS` / `ASK_VERIFY_POLL_ATTEMPTS`) until the modal is
 *     gone, resending the confirm on a `"review"` sighting (bounded by
 *     `ASK_VERIFY_MAX_RESENDS`) and waiting out a `"question"` sighting.
 *
 * The whole sequence runs inside one `queueTmuxOp` callback (same
 * serialization-behind-any-in-flight-paste rationale as `sendModalKeys`), so
 * the confirm-wait and verify polls can't interleave with a racing user
 * paste either. `sendModalKeys` is unchanged and still used for the

 *
 * The scraper runs every ~1s, capture-panes the visible window, and tries

 * the matched block and waits one more tick before registering — a
 * single-tick blip never wins, which suppresses false positives from
 * normal numbered-list output. Once registered, the prompt rides the
 * standard interaction broadcast → SSE → run-panel path; answering ships

 * writes nothing to the JSONL. If the bar never shows a recognised mode
 * within `modeVerifyTimeoutMs` (most likely cause: claude's one-time auto
