 * the `(run_id, IFNULL(subagent_id,''), line_uuid)` partial unique index
 * and the status row would be silently dropped via INSERT OR IGNORE (see
 * the dedicated test in claude-tmux.test.ts). `mapJsonlEventToChunks`
 * passes `true` for its one real caller, the subagent tailer: a subagent's
 * own api-error line needs a durable `line_uuid` so reattach seeding
 * (`seenLineUuidsForSubagent`) reliably recognizes a replayed api-error
 * line even in the edge case where the line carries no text content block
 * (so no assistant chunk exists to carry the uuid instead) — without that,
 * a replayed error line on a boot reattach could re-fire
 * `signalSubagentApiError` against whatever run happens to be in flight at
 * that point. When a text block IS present (the common case), the
 * duplicate write is a harmless no-op — INSERT OR IGNORE silently keeps
 * the first (assistant) row, which already carries the same uuid.
 * @param lastPermissionMode The mode `SessionState.permissionMode` held
 * BEFORE this event (undefined = caller has no tracking — e.g. a test that
 * predates this param, or a one-off call site that doesn't care — always
 * emit, matching pre-existing behavior). Claude journals a mode-bearing
 * event at every turn start, not just on an actual mode change, so without
 * this the `system`/`permission-mode` case below would emit an identical
 * `permission-mode: <mode>` status chip after every single turn. Passing
 * the previous value lets that case suppress the chunk when nothing

 * the scraper-observed `cursorIndex` to the index of the target choice,
 * then Enter. Positive delta → `Down`; negative → `Up`. This matters
 * because the scraper catches a wider set of modals than permission
 * prompts — the model picker and `/login` open with the cursor on the
 * *current* value, not necessarily option 1.
 *
 * Y/N modals: pass `cursorIndex` as undefined — the function falls back
 * to sending the literal `y`/`n` keystroke, which claude's confirm
 * helper handles directly.
 *
 * `ctx.confirmKey`: on the arrow-nav path, the trailing keystroke is
 * `ctx.confirmKey ?? "Enter"` instead of a hardcoded Enter. This exists for
 * claude 2.1.245's bare `/model` picker, whose footer reads `Enter to set as
 * default · s to use this session only · Esc to cancel` — plain Enter there
 * writes the pick as the user's *global* default for all future claude
 * sessions, a side effect a card click through agetor must never cause on
 * the user's behalf. `matchNumberedModal` sets `confirmKey: "s"` whenever
 * that footer text is present (see `SESSION_ONLY_CONFIRM_RE`), which scopes
 * the change to the live session instead; `task.model` still syncs from
 * claude's own `<local-command-stdout>` line regardless of which key
 * confirmed the picker. The y/N path never carries a `confirmKey` (that
 * shape has no arrow nav or footer to match) and is unaffected.
 *
 * Each arrow press is its own `send-keys` invocation with a small sleep
 * between them. A bursted `Down Down Enter` lands as one read on
 * claude's stdin and the trailing Enter can be consumed before the
 * second Down propagates through the Ink reducer — the same race the
 * original `digit + Enter` split was working around.
 *
 * NOT a chat message: we deliberately bypass the `load-buffer +
 * paste-buffer` flow `pastePrompt` uses, because that path delivers the
 * text into claude's input buffer to become the next prompt. The modal
 * wants direct keypresses, not a queued message.
 *
 * Returns true on apparent success (every tmux command exited 0).
 * Silently returns false when no session is registered, when the target
 * key isn't present in the supplied choices, or when the session is
 * disposed mid-body (a `dropSession` + respawn during the inter-
 * keystroke gap would otherwise leak the trailing Enter into the fresh
 * pane as a stray confirmation).
 *
 * Latency: serialized behind any in-flight tmux op for the same task
 * (paste-prompts included), so a click that lands while a `/model X`
 * settle window is still elapsing waits up to `slashCommandSettleMs`
 * (default 700ms) before the first keystroke goes out. A click queued
 * behind a paste that's polling `queuePaste`'s modal guard
 * (docs/plans/model-effort-local-command-turns.md §10) waits out that
 * guard too — up to `PASTE_MODAL_GRACE_MS` (default 1500ms) — before
 * either the guarded paste lands or is withheld and this click's op
 * becomes current. The server route at `server.ts:1420` awaits this

 * it runs `fsStatSync`/`fsOpenSync`/`fsReadSync`/`fsCloseSync` back-to-back
 * with no `await` in between, so no other flush of the same `state.offset`
 * can interleave mid-read. Rewriting it on top of `fs/promises` (mirroring

 * guard exists to close — two overlapping reads of the same byte range, each
 * independently advancing `state.offset` and re-dispatching lines, with a
 * trailing `end_turn` capable of popping the wrong turn slot. Closing that
 * race for real needs a shared in-flight guard both `flush` and this function
 * check *before* their first read (not just after, the way `flush` does now)
 * — restructuring beyond a same-file, same-task conversion, so it's left for
 * a follow-up rather than risked here.
 *
 * The blocking cost this leaves behind is bounded, not unbounded: unlike the
 * tmux spawns this task converts (one full process fork+exec per call) or the
 * SSE replay query (sorts a task's ENTIRE event history), `flushSync` only
 * reads the bytes appended to the JSONL since `state.offset` — normally a
 * single turn's worth of new lines, a few KB at most — via a plain sync
 * stat+read, not a subprocess. That's exactly the class of "µs-scale syscall"

 *       out a lone `▲` glyph on its own line, which the regex alone would

 *       further up a long pane can't win over a live one (same tail-anchored
 *       posture every other matcher here takes);
 *   (b) a label row of at least two tokens matching `[a-z][a-z0-9+]*`,
 *       separated by at least two spaces, found within the next
 *       `LABEL_ROW_SEARCH_NONBLANK` (2) NON-BLANK lines below the track —
 *       the sub-label row under the last entry (`xhigh + workflows`) sits on
 *       a DIFFERENT, later line and is never consulted;
 *   (c) a footer matching `SLIDER_FOOTER_RE` within `FOOTER_SEARCH_NONBLANK`
 *       (3) non-blank lines BELOW THE LABEL ROW found in (b) — anchored to
 *       THIS slider's own label row, not just anywhere in the pane;
 *   (d) that SAME footer line (the exact one (c) found, tracked by line
 *       index) is ALSO one of the last 3 non-blank lines of the WHOLE
 *       tail — i.e. the widget is genuinely sitting at the bottom of the
 *       pane right now, not stale scrollback.
 * The captured layout is track / labels / `xhigh + workflows` sub-row /
 * blank / footer, so (b), (c), and (d) all hold with slack against the
 * measured evidence for a real, live slider.
 *
 * (c) and (d) are deliberately independent checks, not one merged "footer
 * near the bottom" test, because each defeats a DIFFERENT stale-echo shape:
 *   - An OLD slider echo (complete with its own label + footer) sitting in
 *     scrollback, followed by more transcript and then an idle input box:
 *     (c) alone would still match — the echo's own footer is right there,
 *     within `FOOTER_SEARCH_NONBLANK` lines of the echo's own label row.
 *     (d) is what rejects it: that footer is buried under whatever now
 *     follows it, so it is NOT among the tail's last 3 non-blank lines.
 *   - An OLD echo sitting ABOVE a LIVE slider whose track has since
 *     scrolled off the top of the captured tail (so only the live label +
 *     footer are still visible, no `▲` track for them): the bottom-up track
 *     search in (a) falls back to the echo's stale track line (the only one
 *     left in view), and the live footer legitimately IS in the tail's last
 *     3 non-blank lines — so (d) alone would wrongly pass. (c) is what
 *     rejects it: the live footer sits far below the STALE label row (b)
 *     found for the stale track, well outside `FOOTER_SEARCH_NONBLANK`
 *     lines — so this returns null and correctly falls through to
 *     `matchUnparsableModal` instead of fabricating a card for a widget
 *     whose actual track is no longer visible to drive against.
 *
 * `cursorIndex` is the label whose horizontal centre column is nearest the
 * `▲` column (ties broken toward the lower index via strict `<`) — the `▲`
 * sits between labels far more often than exactly under one, so "nearest"
 * is what makes the mapping stable across every discrete slider position.
 * `highConfidence: true`: unlike `matchNumberedModal`'s footer fast-path
 * (extra confidence layered on an already-parsed choice set), the footer
 * here (signals c/d together) is a REQUIRED condition for a match to exist
 * at all, so a first sighting is already as trustworthy as a stable one —
 * same reasoning `matchUnparsableModal`'s doc gives for why IT is never
 * `highConfidence`, applied in the opposite direction. `nav: "horizontal"`
 * is what tells `dismissTmuxPrompt` to send `Right`/`Left` instead of
 * `Down`/`Up`.

 *

 *       fixed raw-line slice, because `tmux capture-pane` pads trailing blank
 *       rows (same reasoning as `matchNumberedModal`'s high-confidence check).
 *   (2) Watchdog arm — `watchdogArmed` (the caller pre-computes this via
 *       `stuckTurnFallbackArmed`, since it needs session state this pure
 *       matcher doesn't have).
 *
 * Deliberately never `highConfidence` (see `ScrapeMatch.unparsable`): unlike
 * `matchNumberedModal`'s footer fast-path, footer presence here IS the
 * trigger itself, not extra confidence layered on top of an already-parsed
 * choice set — so a single-tick sighting must not register a card. The caller
 * (`scrapeOnce`) holds this to `UNPARSABLE_STABILITY_TICKS` (3) consecutive
 * equal-fingerprint sightings, stricter than the generic two-tick gate —
 * skipping it would let a mid-repaint transient (a real modal's frame still

 *
 *   - `matchNumberedModal(tail) ?? matchYesNoModal(tail) ?? matchSliderModal(tail)`
 *     non-null — a numbered / yes-no / slider modal is on screen.
 *   - `detectAskModal(tail) === "question"` — a live AskUserQuestion
 *     question screen (the OTHER kind, `"review"`, is deliberately excluded
 *     here, mirroring `scrapeOnce`'s own `askOnPane` gate: a review screen's
 *     `❯ 1. Submit answers` / `2. Cancel` already satisfies the numbered-modal
 *     arm above, so this function would already have returned `true` for it
 *     via that arm regardless).
 *   - the FOOTER arm of `matchUnparsableModal(tail, false)` (watchdogArmed
 *     forced `false` — this function has no `SessionState` to compute
 *     `stuckTurnFallbackArmed` from, and doesn't need one: the watchdog arm
 *     exists to catch a turn that's been silently stuck for 60s+, a
 *     different question from "is a modal drawn on the pane right now"),
 *     but ONLY when `!paneShowsClaudeWorking(tail)` — mirroring `scrapeOnce`'s
 *     own `paneWorking ? null : matchUnparsableModal(...)` gate on that same
 *     arm. Without it, a long-running tool call's own footer-ish output
 *     (`esc to cancel`, a busy spinner's chrome) could false-fire the guard
 *     while claude is plainly still working, not blocked on a modal.
 *
 * Two things this function deliberately does NOT replicate from
 * `scrapeOnce`'s full gate, and why that's fine for THIS caller:
 *   - `scrapeOnce`'s top-level `claudeIsWriting || (askOnPane &&
 *     !askUnrecoverable) ? null : …` short-circuit, which suppresses ALL
 *     matchers (including numbered/yes-no/slider) while claude is actively
 *     streaming assistant text. A real modal replaces that streaming chrome
 *     entirely, so the matchers above wouldn't spuriously hit mid-stream
 *     anyway — the short-circuit exists to avoid a stale sighting further up
 *     the same tail, not to change whether a modal on THIS tick is real.
 *   - `matchUnparsableModal`'s `UNPARSABLE_STABILITY_TICKS` (3 consecutive
 *     equal-fingerprint sightings) requirement before `scrapeOnce` ever
 *     registers a card off it. This function has no per-call state to track
 *     ticks across, and doesn't need one: `scrapeOnce` holds that bar
 *     because carding a transient repaint would drive a WRONG keystroke into
 *     a modal that isn't really there. `queuePaste`'s modal guard only ever
 *     WITHHOLDS on a hit — no keystroke goes anywhere — and a false-positive
 *     withhold self-heals the moment the caller resends (or the guard's own
 *     next poll tick sees the pane clear); an under-strict, single-tick
 *     over-fire here costs a retry, not a wrong action.
 *
 * Used by `queuePaste`'s modal guard (see `capturePastePane` /
 * `PASTE_MODAL_GRACE_MS`) to decide whether a pending paste would land IN a
 * live modal instead of claude's composer — pasting text into a modal
 * confirms whatever the cursor happens to be on (or is silently swallowed),
 * neither of which is "deliver this as the next chat message." Naming
 * mirrors `paneShowsClaudeWorking` / `paneShowsIdleInputBox`: a pane-state
 * question, not an action.
 *
 * Built directly on the shared `pickScrapeMatch` chain (docs/plans/model-
 * effort-local-command-turns.md §10 re-review finding #10) rather than
 * re-listing `matchNumberedModal ?? matchYesNoModal ?? matchSliderModal` and
 * the `paneWorking`-gated `matchUnparsableModal` fallback by hand — this
 * function had drifted into a THIRD hand-copy of that same chain (alongside
 * `scrapeOnce` and the boot poller), which is exactly the kind of duplication
 * that lets one copy silently fall behind when the chain's precedence or

 * docs/plans/model-effort-local-command-turns.md §10 review finding #1: the

 * while a turn is in flight, an image-bearing paste's own bracketed gap can
 * sleep up to `IMAGE_ATTACH_SETTLE_MAX_MS` (3s) before its Enter goes out,

 * accumulate 3 "eligible" ticks well before the pane has genuinely gone
 * stale, on a session that was otherwise idle past `STUCK_TURN_FALLBACK_MS`
 * a turn or two ago.
 *
 * The clock used to be `lastActivityAt`, and that was WRONG in the one case
 * this net exists for (smoke, claude 2.1.246): `lastActivityAt` is also
 * bumped by `scrapeOnce`'s own pane diff, and claude's idle status bar
 * flickers its right-hand hint (`● high · /effort`) roughly once a second, so

 * NEVER satisfied on a genuinely idle pane. A run stranded by an unsettleable
 * local-command adoption sat `running` for 6 minutes with `paneShowsIdleInputBox`
 * true the whole time and `signalIdleSettle` never firing. `lastKeystrokeAt`
 * measures only what AGETOR did, which is the actual hazard (settling a turn
 * whose prompt we just delivered) — claude repainting its own chrome is not.

/**
 * Paste a follow-up user message into a live session's tmux input buffer

 * a turn is already in flight: claude's TUI queues the keystrokes and replays
 * them as part of the current (often coalesced) response, so we fold the
 * message into the active run instead of opening a new turn slot.
 *
 * Why no new slot (unlike `sendTurn`): claude can coalesce several queued
 * messages into fewer `end_turn` events than messages. One slot per message
 * would then strand the surplus slots in `turnQueue` forever (their runs stuck
 * `running`). With no extra slot there is nothing to strand — the single
 * active slot carries the whole busy period.
 *
 * Sets `state.holdUntilIdle` so the run doesn't resolve on the *intermediate*
 * end_turn between the current response and the folded message — otherwise the
 * task would bounce to `review` while claude is still working on the follow-up.
 * The slot resolves only when claude goes quiet (the idle-fire in `flush`),
 * i.e. "the end is the end."
 *
 * Why no `flushSync` (unlike `sendTurn`): `sendTurn` drains leftover JSONL
 * before pushing its new slot so a stale end_turn can't pop the fresh slot.
 * Here there is no new slot to protect, and running `flushSync` would instead
 * fire a staged `pendingEndTurn` and pop the live slot mid-turn — resolving
 * the active run early. So we set the hold, paste, and nothing else.
 *
 * **Return shape.** `false` when no live session exists (caller falls back to
 * spawning) — deliberately the same falsy value this function has always
 * returned for that case, so every existing `if (pasteFollowUp(…))` /
 * `const delivered = pasteFollowUp(…); if (delivered)` call site keeps
 * working unchanged. On the happy path it now returns an OBJECT rather than
 * `true`:
 *
 *   `{ delivered: true; pasteOutcome: Promise<PasteOutcome> }`
 *
 * `delivered: true` means only what the old `true` meant — a live session
 * exists and the paste has been ENQUEUED — while `pasteOutcome` is the
 * never-rejecting promise for whether those keystrokes actually reached
 * claude's composer (same contract as `SpawnedAgent.pasteOutcome`; settles
 * exactly once, including when the queued op is dropped without running).
 * The two are deliberately separate: enqueueing is synchronous and the
 * caller's optimistic "user" bubble depends on it, but the real delivery
 * verdict only exists a tick or more later.
 *
 * @param opts.onPasteFailure Forwarded verbatim to the underlying
 * `queuePaste` — fires when the paste (including a withheld one, from
 * `queuePaste`'s modal guard) doesn't land. Unlike `sendTurn`, this path
 * pushes no turn slot to settle, so the orchestrator's callback has nothing
 * to reject; it re-stashes `prompt` back into the task's backlog instead, so
 * a message folded in while a live claude modal is up isn't silently lost.
 * The callback and `pasteOutcome` describe the same event — use whichever
 * shape fits the call site; both fire for every failure.

 *
 * Historically used by the orchestrator to mirror inline config edits onto a

 * changes don't have a slash command — see `cycleToMode`.) Keeping the
 * session alive preserves the conversation context across config changes.
 *
 * @param opts `autoConfirm` names which config dimension this mirror is for
 * (`"model"` / `"effort"`) so a follow-up auto-accepts claude's "Switch
 * model?" / "Change effort level?" confirm on 2.1.245 — the user already
 * chose via the Task Details dropdown, so that confirm shouldn't need a
 * second click. Left `undefined` for a user-typed `/model x` / `/effort x`:
 * claude asked, so the user answers via the ordinary numbered `tmux_prompt`
 * card `matchNumberedModal` still registers for it in the scrape chains.
 *
 * `opts.onPasteFailure` is forwarded verbatim to the underlying `queuePaste`
 * (finding #4, docs/plans/model-effort-local-command-turns.md §10) — fires
 * when the mirror paste is withheld by `queuePaste`'s modal guard (or fails
 * outright). This function pushes no turn slot, so there's nothing here to
 * settle; the orchestrator's callback is what surfaces a
 * "… not applied — claude is waiting on a prompt" status on the task's
 * latest run. `queuePaste`'s own status emit (through
 * `expectedState.turnQueue[0]?.onChunk ?? expectedState.lastChunk`) still
 * fires independently of this — it's a no-op when no handler is listening,
 * so the orchestrator's callback is simply the visible one in practice.
 *
 * When `opts.autoConfirm` is set, a follow-up op is enqueued through the
 * SAME per-task tmux-op chain (`queueTmuxOp` reads `pasteChains.get(taskId)`,
 * which the `queuePaste` call just above set — calling `queueTmuxOp` again
 * synchronously, with no `await` in between, chains this step directly
 * behind the paste AND its `slashCommandSettleMs` settle window without this
 * function needing to await anything itself). That step polls the pane
 * every `SLASH_CONFIRM_POLL_MS` for up to `SLASH_CONFIRM_WINDOW_MS`; on the
 * first `matchSlashConfirmModal(tail, kind)` hit it sends Enter and, only
 * once that send-keys actually succeeds, stamps the fingerprint answered
 * (`markTmuxPromptAnswered` — so a `tmux_prompt` the scraper may have raced
 * into existence for it is not ghost-registered on the next tick — finding
 * #6, docs/plans/model-effort-local-command-turns.md §10 review: stamping
 * BEFORE a send-keys that might still fail would mark the confirm answered
 * when it demonstrably wasn't, leaving nothing to re-card it) and resolves
 * any already-registered prompt for that exact fingerprint immediately
 * (`answerTmuxPrompt(..., { key: "__external__" })`) rather than waiting for
 * the next scrape's auto-cancel sweep to notice it's gone. Anything else on
 * the pane — the inline
 * no-confirm path is the COMMON case on 2.1.245 — is a no-op: Enter is
 * NEVER sent on unmatched pane content, and the window just elapses.
 *
 * Early exit: the inline no-confirm path settles onto claude's idle input
 * box (`paneShowsIdleInputBox`) within a few hundred ms, so once that's been

 * The model FAMILY word a bare-`/model` picker row names, or null when the

 *
 * Captured picker rows (claude 2.1.246, smoke; the column gap is a run of
 * spaces, and `✔` marks the row that is currently in effect):
 *
 *   1. Default (recommended)  Opus 5 with 1M context, best for complex work
 *   2. Opus (1M context)      Opus 5 with 1M context …

 *   5. Haiku                  Haiku 4.5 …
 *
 * So the parse is: take everything before the FIRST run of ≥2 spaces (that
 * column gap is what separates the name from the description — a single space
 * can't be used, several names contain one), strip `✔`, then take the leading
 * word. The leading-word step is load-bearing, not cosmetic: row 2's name is
 * `Opus (1M context)`, and a caller asking for the `Opus` family must match it
 * (an exact whole-name comparison would miss, and the feature would report
 * "target not offered" for the single most common target).
 *
 * Taking only the leading word is also what keeps the DESCRIPTION out of the
 * decision — row 1's description says "Opus 5 …" while its name is `Default`,
 * and picking it would write a *floating* default rather than the family the
 * caller asked for.

/**
 * Mirror a model change onto a live claude session by DRIVING THE BARE
 * `/model` PICKER and confirming it with `s` ("use this session only") —
 * never by typing `/model <id>`.
 *
 * **Why not `/model <id>`.** Smoke-verified on claude 2.1.246: typing
 * `/model claude-sonnet-5` (what the dropdown mirror used to send) is a
 * GLOBAL write — `~/.claude/settings.json`'s `model` key changes, so every
 * future claude the user starts ANYWHERE inherits agetor's pick. A task-level
 * dropdown must not have machine-level side effects. The bare picker's footer
 * offers `Enter to set as default · s to use this session only · Esc to
 * cancel`; `s` scopes the change to the live session, which is exactly the
 * blast radius a per-task setting should have. (This is the same reasoning,
 * and the same key, that `matchNumberedModal`'s `confirmKey` already applies
 * when a HUMAN answers the picker through a card — see
 * `SESSION_ONLY_CONFIRM_RE`. `task.model` still syncs from claude's own
 * `<local-command-stdout>` either way, so agetor's bookkeeping doesn't depend
 * on which key confirmed.)
 *
 * **The 2.1.246 picker** (smoke capture) — 5 rows, `✔` on the row in effect,
 * a `≥2`-space column gap between each row's name and its description:
 *
 *   ❯ 1. Default (recommended)  Opus 5 with 1M context, best for complex work
 *     2. Opus (1M context)      Opus 5 with 1M context …
 *     3. Fable                  Fable 5 …
 *     4. Sonnet ✔               Sonnet 5 …
 *     5. Haiku                  Haiku 4.5 …
 *   Enter to set as default · s to use this session only · Esc to cancel
 *
 * It registered as a card in 1.05 s in that capture, comfortably inside
 * `SLASH_CONFIRM_WINDOW_MS`. Pressing `s` on a row other than the current one
 * then pops `Switch model?` (`❯ 1. Yes, switch to Opus 5 (1M context)` /
 * `2. No, go back`), which this function accepts through the SAME
 * `autoConfirmSlashModal` path `sendSlashCommand({ autoConfirm: "model" })`
 * uses — the user already chose in the dropdown, so a second click would be
 * noise. `targetFamily` is one of `Opus` / `Sonnet` / `Fable` / `Haiku`; the
 * orchestrator owns mapping an agetor model id onto that word.
 *
 * **Sequencing.** The bare `/model` paste goes through `queuePaste` (so it
 * inherits the modal guard — a picker must never be opened by pasting INTO
 * some other live modal) with the usual `slashCommandSettleMs`. Everything
 * after it — poll, arrow-walk, `s`, confirm — runs in ONE `queueTmuxOp`
 * enqueued SYNCHRONOUSLY right behind that paste, with no `await` in between,
 * so nothing else on the task's tmux chain can interleave between opening the
 * picker and answering it. Every keystroke is gated on `stillCurrent()`.
 *
 * **Never open the picker on a busy session** (finding #2, wave-5
 * re-review). Checked twice: once at entry, before the `/model` paste is
 * even enqueued, and again as the FIRST thing the driving `queueTmuxOp`
 * callback does once it actually runs — the entry check ran before that
 * paste was even queued, and claude can transition into working chrome
 * (a background agent picking up, a long tool call) in the gap between
 * enqueue and this op's turn on the per-task chain. Both checks are the same
 * test: `turnInFlight(state)` (a live JSONL turn slot) OR
 * `paneShowsClaudeWorking(capturePastePane(state))` (working chrome with no
 * turn slot at all — background-agent activity). Either hit returns
 * `{ ok: false, reason: "turn in flight" }` WITHOUT pasting anything (the
 * entry check) or without driving any further keystrokes (the re-check,
 * which runs after the `/model` paste already went out on the chain — see
 * "Sequencing" above). This matters because claude's TUI QUEUES a bare
 * slash command typed mid-turn instead of opening the picker immediately —
 * it can replay as a picker minutes later, long after this function's own
 * poll window has given up, with nothing left to drive it.
 *
 * **Failure modes**, all of which leave the session in a state the user or
 * the scraper can take over from:
 *   - `no live session` — nothing to drive (also returned when the queued op
 *     was dropped because the session was replaced mid-flight).
 *   - `turn in flight` — a turn was in flight (or the pane showed claude
 *     working) at entry, or again by the time the driving op ran; see above.
 *     NO keystroke is sent.
 *   - `paste withheld` — `queuePaste`'s modal guard refused to open the
 *     picker; `opts.onPasteFailure` fires with the real outcome first. NO
 *     keystroke is sent.
 *   - `picker not shown` — the poll window elapsed with no picker on the
 *     pane. NO keystroke is sent; whatever IS on the pane is left for the
 *     scraper's own matcher chain to card.
 *   - `target not offered` — the picker is up but has no row for
 *     `targetFamily` (claude renamed or dropped it). The picker is CLOSED
 *     with `Escape` rather than left hanging, and never confirmed on a
 *     wrong row; the fingerprint is stamped answered only if that Escape's
 *     `send-keys` actually landed (finding #4, wave-5 re-review) — a failed
 *     send-keys leaves the picker genuinely on the pane, so it must stay
 *     eligible for the scraper's own matcher chain to card, mirroring the
 *     same rule `autoConfirmSlashModal` applies to its own Enter.
 *   - `keystroke failed` — a `send-keys` returned non-zero part-way through.
 *
 * **Suppresses the scraper while driving** (finding #3, wave-5 re-review):
 * `SessionState.drivingPrompt` is set for the duration of the driving
 * `queueTmuxOp` callback (try/finally, so it clears on every exit path) —
 * `scrapeOnce` skips registering a NEW `tmux_prompt` card while it's true,
 * the same idea as the existing `askCollecting` guard. The picker's footer
 * (`Enter to set as default · s to use this session only · Esc to cancel`)
 * makes it `highConfidence` in `matchNumberedModal` — it would otherwise card
 * on the very first scrape tick, and a concurrent card click racing this
 * function's own keystrokes would enqueue `dismissTmuxPrompt` behind this
 * op on the same per-task chain, potentially confirming the wrong row.
 *
 * **Stamps the mirror attribution window.** The moment the session-only
 * confirm key lands, `SessionState.lastModelMirrorAt` is set to now — the
 * only write site for that clock. It is what lets the orchestrator treat a
 * following `Kept model as <X>` (the user declining the `Switch model?` this
 * function just provoked) as a row correction, while a `Kept model as <X>`
 * from a bare user-typed `/model` + Esc leaves the row's next-run choice
 * alone. Neither the opening paste nor the `target not offered` Escape exit
 * stamps it — see the field's doc.

 * command despite what the prior code assumed). For the `plan` target we
 * prefer the `/plan` slash command instead: it's deterministic, doesn't
 * depend on knowing the current mode, and works from anywhere.
 *
 * After each batch of presses we scrape the tmux status bar (see
 * `readPaneMode`) and compare it to the target. A mismatch — account isn't
 * auto-eligible (cycle is 3-wide instead of 4), assumed press count was
 * off, etc. — triggers another attempt from the newly-observed mode, up
 * to `MAX_VERIFY_ATTEMPTS` times. We scrape the bar rather than wait for a
 * JSONL `permission-mode` event because claude only journals that event at
 * the *next turn start*; an idle Shift+Tab updates the bar immediately but
 * writes nothing to the JSONL. If the bar never shows a recognised mode
 * within `modeVerifyTimeoutMs` (most likely cause: claude's one-time auto
 * opt-in modal is painted over it), we bail with `verification timed out` so
 * the orchestrator can warn the user rather than report a successful mode
 * change that didn't happen.

 *     to the target (verified by scraping the status bar).
 *   - `{ ok: false, reason: "no live session" }` for an unknown task.
 *   - `{ ok: false, reason: "current mode unknown" }` before claude's first

 *     isn't reachable (e.g. `bypassPermissions` without the launch flag —

 *     when the status bar never confirmed the new mode after our keystrokes.
 *   - `{ ok: false, reason: "verification mismatch", attempts, lastObserved }`

 *
 * Async (renamed from `pastePromptSync` — docs/plans/fix-task-details-load-

 * loop across the `await`.
 *
 * The load-bearing invariant is no longer "no awaits between tmux calls"
 * (that guarantee is gone by construction) — it's that this whole
 * micro-sequence is only ever invoked from inside a `queueTmuxOp`/`queuePaste`
 * body on the PER-TASK chain (`pasteChains`), so two calls for the *same*
 * task can never interleave their four steps with each other. Cross-task
 * interleaving is safe by construction too: each call targets a distinct
 * tmux session (`-t sessionName`) and a distinct, session-scoped buffer name
 * (`agetor-${sessionName}`), so even fully-concurrent awaits for different
 * tasks can never step on each other's buffer or pane. A session dying
 * mid-sequence (between, say, load-buffer and paste-buffer) is no longer
 * structurally impossible the way a single synchronous call made it — but it
 * doesn't need to be: the next tmux call in the sequence just comes back
 * `ok: false` (session gone), which this function already turns into a
 * `TmuxPasteFailure` the caller (`queuePaste`) already knows how to handle
 * (re-stash to the backlog, surface a status line) exactly as it does for
 * any other tmux failure.
 *
 * `skipEnter` defers the trailing Enter to the caller so it can insert a
 * gap before the `send-keys Enter`. See `queuePaste`'s bracketed branch
 * for the rationale (and the image-attach scaling layered on top of it).
 *
 * Callers go through `queuePaste` so back-to-back pastes for the same
 * task can't interleave at the tmux layer. See `queuePaste` for why.
 *
 * Returns a `{ ok: true } | TmuxPasteFailure` (the subset of `PasteOutcome`
 * an actual tmux call can produce — see `TmuxPasteFailure`'s doc) so a

 * Append a tmux operation to the per-task chain. The `fn` thunk runs
 * after every prior op for the same task has settled. Errors thrown by
 * `fn` are logged but never rejected onto the returned promise — one
 * transient tmux failure shouldn't poison every subsequent op for the
 * session. The returned promise resolves once `fn` (including any internal
 * delays it awaits) has settled, which is when the *next* chained op
 * becomes eligible to run. Callers fire-and-forget unless they need to
 * synchronize with the op's completion (e.g. `dismissTmuxPrompt`, which
 * needs to read the result of the final `send-keys Enter`).
 *
 * Used directly for ops that aren't a simple `paste-buffer + Enter`
 * (modal dismissals send individual `send-keys` with their own internal
 * gap). `queuePaste` is the convenience wrapper for the common case.
 *
 * `expectedState`, when provided, is captured at scheduling time and
 * compared against `sessions.get(taskId)` right before `fn` runs (the
 * one-shot entry gate) AND surfaced to `fn` as the `stillCurrent()`
 * predicate so thunks with internal awaits can re-check between tmux
 * calls. This closes the narrow race where `sessionNameFor(taskId)` is
 * deterministic, so a re-spawn for the same task reuses the same tmux
 * session name and a previously-queued op would otherwise send
 * keystrokes into the *new* session — including the case where
 * `dropSession` lands DURING `fn`'s `Bun.sleep` gap, leaving the
 * trailing tmux call to leak into the respawned pane.
 *
 * ⚠️ Production callers MUST pass `expectedState`. The parameter is
 * optional only because the unit test suite (`claude-tmux-queue.test.ts`)
 * needs to drive the chain without installing a full SessionState for
 * every ordering assertion; omitting it disables the gate entirely. If
 * you're wiring up a new tmux op from any non-test code, pass the
 * `SessionState` you got from `sessions.get(taskId)` — that's what
 * makes the gate fire. The `expectedState`-less form behaves as if the
 * gate is permanently open.
 *
 * `fn` receives a `stillCurrent()` predicate it can call before any
 * post-await tmux work. When `expectedState` is omitted the predicate
 * is always `true` (consistent with no-gate behavior).

/**
 * Convenience wrapper over `queueTmuxOp` for the common case: paste
 * `text` into `sessionName` and (optionally) hold the chain for
 * `settleMs` afterwards so claude's TUI has time to finish processing
 * the line before the next op runs.
 *
 * The returned promise resolves AFTER the paste AND the settle delay —
 * i.e. when the next chained op becomes eligible, NOT when tmux has
 * received the paste. Callers awaiting "did tmux get the keystrokes"
 * should not infer that from this promise; the only thing the promise
 * guarantees is chain ordering.
 *
 * Pass `expectedState` to gate the paste on the session still being
 * the one this paste was scheduled against — see `queueTmuxOp` for the
 * race this closes.
 *
 * When `opts.bracketed` is true, the trailing `Enter` is split out of the
 * paste body — load-buffer + paste-buffer land back-to-back, each its own
 * awaited `tmux()` round-trip, with no deliberate gap between them — and
 * sent after a small internal gap
 * (`bracketedEnterGapMs`) so claude's Ink TUI commits the `ESC[200~ …
 * ESC[201~` paste event before the `\r` arrives — without that gap the
 * Enter is absorbed as part of the paste event and the queued bubble
 * sits unsubmitted. The deferred Enter is re-gated through
 * `stillCurrent()` so a `dropSession` landing during the gap can't
 * leak the keystroke into a respawned pane.
 *
 * **Modal guard** (docs/plans/model-effort-local-command-turns.md §10):
 * right before either paste path runs, when `expectedState` is set and
 * `opts.skipModalGuard` isn't, the queued op polls `capturePastePane`
 * (`PASTE_MODAL_POLL_MS`, up to `opts.modalGuardGraceMs ??
 * PASTE_MODAL_GRACE_MS`) until `paneShowsBlockingPrompt` reports the pane
 * clear. This is what stops a paste from ever typing Enter into a live
 * claude modal — the confirm the user hasn't answered yet would swallow the
 * pasted text and/or confirm whatever the cursor happens to be on, neither
 * of which is "deliver this as the next chat message." If the modal is
 * STILL there once the grace window elapses, `stillBlocking` (a double
 * sample — finding #3, §10 review) confirms it isn't just a mid-repaint
 * transient before the paste is WITHHELD (no `pastePrompt` call at
 * all): a `status` chunk + console log surface it, and `opts.onPasteFailure`
 * fires with `{ ok: false, op: "modal-guard", phase: "pre-paste" }` exactly
 * like any other paste failure, so a caller with a turn slot (`sendTurn`)
 * settles it as failed instead of leaving the run stuck `running`.
 *
 * **Composer-clear check** (finding #2, §10 review; re-reviewed §10 again):
 * right after the pre-paste guard clears and before either paste path runs,
 * when `expectedState.composerHoldsText` is set (a PRIOR paste on this
 * session withheld its Enter with text already sitting in claude's
 * composer — see the pre-Enter re-check below, and the trailing-Enter
 * failure branches in both paste paths, which set the same flag), this
 * either clears that leftover text (`COMPOSER_CLEAR_KEYS`, idle pane only,
 * checked for `.ok` like any other tmux call) or withholds the NEW paste
 * with `phase: "composer-dirty"` — pasting on top of unsent text would
 * concatenate rather than replace it. No safe clear exists while claude is
 * working (Escape/Ctrl-C would interrupt the turn), so a working pane
 * withholds immediately instead of attempting one. The clear is verified
 * POSITIVELY afterwards — `paneShowsIdleInputBox` must report a confirmed
 * bare row (and `paneShowsBlockingPrompt` must NOT be showing) — rather than
 * merely `!paneShowsComposerText`, which can't tell "cleared to bare" apart
 * from "a NEW modal replaced the composer entirely" (a modal fails
 * `paneShowsComposerText` too). The "already bare" branch requires that same
 * positive `paneShowsIdleInputBox` read rather than the negation, for the
 * identical reason; a pane that satisfies neither predicate (no live prompt
 * row at all) withholds rather than guessing.
 *
 * WHEN the composer-clear block above actually attempted a clear (sent
 * `COMPOSER_CLEAR_KEYS` and slept `COMPOSER_CLEAR_SETTLE_MS` — not the
 * already-bare branch, which inserts no delay) — a further one-shot,
 * double-sampled (`stillBlocking`) re-check of `paneShowsBlockingPrompt` runs
 * right before dispatch, covering BOTH paste paths, since the non-bracketed
 * one sends paste+Enter back-to-back — each its own awaited `tmux()`
 * round-trip, with no deliberate gap — and so has no pre-Enter net of its
 * own (unlike the bracketed path's own re-check below).
 *
 * The modal guard re-runs a THIRD time — one-shot, double-sampled via
 * `stillBlocking`, no polling loop — right before the deferred bracketed
 * Enter (when `opts.bracketed`), still gated on `expectedState &&
 * !opts.skipModalGuard`. A TOCTOU window opens between the pre-paste guard
 * clearing and the Enter actually going out: the `bracketedEnterGapMs` /
 * image-attach sleep and the `stillCurrent()` re-gate both land in between,
 * and either can outlast a NEW blocking modal appearing (a permission
 * prompt claude's own tool call raises mid-paste, for instance) that the
 * pre-paste guard never saw. By this point the text is ALREADY sitting in
 * claude's input buffer — the paste itself already landed — so a hit here
 * withholds only the Enter, with `{ ok: false, op: "modal-guard", phase:
 * "pre-enter" }` and a status message that says so explicitly (the message
 * is already in the input box; it'll be cleared before the next send)
 * rather than repeating the pre-paste wording, and it sets
 * `expectedState.composerHoldsText = true` so the composer-clear check
 * above knows to clean up before the next paste. A genuine tmux `send-keys`
 * failure on that same trailing Enter (bracketed or not) sets the identical
 * flag (finding #7, §10 re-review) — the preceding `paste-buffer` already
 * landed the text, so the composer holds it regardless of WHY the Enter
 * itself didn't go out. Any paste whose Enter actually goes out successfully
 * clears the flag — submitting the composer, including a message the flag
 * may have been set for.
 *
 * **Dropped ops** (finding #5, wave-5 re-review): a queued paste can also
 * never run its body at all — `queueTmuxOp`'s own identity gate drops it
 * when `dropSession` tears down (or a respawn replaces) the `SessionState`
 * this paste was scheduled against before the chain reaches it. That case is
 * NOT silent: the returned promise's own backstop (see `PASTE_DROPPED_OUTCOME`
 * below) fires `opts.onPasteOutcome`/`opts.onPasteFailure` with a
 * `stderr` that says exactly what happened, so a dropped op now behaves like
 * any other paste failure — a caller that pushed a turn slot for this paste
 * (`sendTurn`) settles it instead of leaving the run stuck `running`, and the
 * orchestrator's `onPasteFailure` handling re-stashes the message rather than
 * losing it when `dropSession` lands mid-paste.
