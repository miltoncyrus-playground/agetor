/**
 * Multi-provider git-forge detection + auth resolution
 * (docs/plans/multi-provider-git-modal.md, docs/plans/github-multi-identity-tokens.md).
 *
 * This module is the provider-agnostic counterpart to `repoForDir`/`githubToken`
 * in `github.ts`: it resolves *which* provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) a
 * project directory's git remote points at, and how to authenticate against
 * it, without hard-gating to `github.com` the way `parseGitHubRemote` does.
 *
 * Raw-host-is-identity convention: a user pins per-identity SSH keys via
 * `~/.ssh/config` host aliases (`git@gitlab-work.io:group/app.git`), so the
 * host in a remote URL is often not the provider's real hostname.
 * `canonicalGitHost` (github.ts) maps any such alias to the provider's cloud
 * hostname (`gitlab.com`, `bitbucket.org`, …) for API-base-URL purposes, but
 * the RAW pre-canonicalization host is what identifies this specific
 * account/workspace — that's the key the token store (`github-tokens.ts`) is
 * keyed by, and it's already host-keyed with zero schema change needed to
 * hold gitlab/bitbucket alias hosts alongside github ones.
 *
 * Leaf module: does not import `db.ts` or `server.ts`. May import from
 * `github-tokens.ts`, `../shared/types.ts`, and `github.ts` (only the
 * provider-agnostic exports: `parseGitRemote`, `canonicalGitHost`, `run`).
 *
 * `remoteHostsForDirs` (docs/plans/consolidate-git-host-discovery.md) lives
 * here rather than in `github.ts` for the same reason the rest of this file
 * does: it needs to be provider-generic over `providerRepoForDir`, and
 * `github.ts` can't import this module (this module imports `github.ts` for
 * `parseGitRemote`/`canonicalGitHost`/`run` — the reverse edge would cycle).
 * It used to live in github.ts with its own duplicated
 * supported-provider-hosts set and inline remote-walk for exactly that
 * reason; moving it here instead of duplicating deletes the duplication.

 * only local authority that can, because it performs the exact same
 * Include/Match/Host-pattern resolution a real `ssh` invocation for that
 * remote would, without opening a network connection (`-G` just prints the
 * fully-resolved client configuration and exits).
 *
 * Parses the `hostname <value>` line `ssh -G` always emits: for an alias
 * this is the resolved `HostName` (e.g. `gitlab.com`); for a plain domain
 * with no matching config entry, ssh's default behavior is to echo the
 * input back (lowercased — ssh lowercases hostnames during config
 * resolution, which is harmless here since DNS/HTTP hostnames are
 * case-insensitive).
 *
 * Never throws and never blocks longer than `SSH_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS`: any
 * failure (missing `ssh` binary, non-zero exit, timeout, unparseable
 * output, empty resolved hostname) falls back to returning `remoteHost`
 * unchanged — today's behavior. Synchronous and cached (see `apiHostCache`
 * above) because this feeds `gitlabApiBase` (H2, gitlab.ts), which is called
 * inline from ~25 template-literal call sites that have no reason to become
 * async just for this.
 *
