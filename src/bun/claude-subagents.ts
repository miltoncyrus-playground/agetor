/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── *
 * Background / sub-agent tracking.
 *
 * When a claude task spawns a sub-agent (the Agent/Task tool — Explore,
 * general-purpose, …, whether synchronous or run-in-background), claude writes
 * that agent's FULL transcript to its own sidechain file, a sibling of the main
 * session JSONL we already tail:
 *
 *   ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl            ← main stream
 *   ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>/subagents/
 *         agent-<agentId>.jsonl      ← per-subagent transcript (isSidechain:true)
 *         agent-<agentId>.meta.json  ← { agentType, description, toolUseId, spawnDepth }
 *
 * The `<sessionId>/subagents/` dir is created lazily — it only exists once a
 * sub-agent has run. We watch it, tail each `agent-*.jsonl` with the SAME
 * mapper the main stream uses (`mapJsonlEventToChunks`), and persist/emit each
 * event tagged with the subagent's id so the run panel can render a read-only
 * per-subagent tab. The main session JSONL still shows the launching `Agent`
 * tool-use card; the tab is the drill-in.
 *
 * A `running` row settles via one of FOUR signals, in rough order of how
 * often each fires: (1) the subagent's own file reaching an assistant
 * `stop_reason:"end_turn"` line and then going idle for `DONE_IDLE_MS`
 * (`checkDone` below); (2) a `<task-notification>` for it landing in the MAIN
 * session JSONL — this covers BOTH workflow containers AND ordinary
 * async/background subagent rows (`scanLineForTaskNotification` below; live
 * dispatch of the same notification via claude-tmux's `fireBackgroundTaskSettled`
 * is one-shot and never re-dispatched on reattach, so once the tmux tailer is
 * gone this scan is the only restart-safe path left for an async agent); (3)
 * this module's own scan of the MAIN session JSONL for a `tool_result` block
 * whose `tool_use_id` matches a tracked subagent's `toolUseId`
 * (`scanLineForToolResult` below) — the fallback for a *synchronous*
 * top-level subagent whose own file never gets a terminal end_turn line (a
 * flush loss under concurrent subagents) and which gets no task-notification
 * either; (4) a terminal staleness backstop (`checkStale` below) that settles
 * a `running` row with no `sawEndOfTurn` and no newly-appended bytes for
 * `STALE_SUBAGENT_SETTLE_MS` — the last resort for a row whose transcript
 * lost its end_turn AND whose one-shot receipt (2)/(3) is gone or was never
 * written. All four funnel through `settleSubagentById` so the DB write /
 * lifecycle emit / hold-release bookkeeping only lives in one place.
 *
 * Signal (3) has a stub guard in front of it: an ASYNC agent's `tool_result`
 * is an *immediate* launch acknowledgement (`toolUseResult.status ===
 * "async_launched"`), not a real completion. `scanLineForToolResult` detects
 * that shape and, instead of settling, marks the row `isAsync` and retires
 * its `toolUseId` — a real `tool_result` never arrives for an async agent, so
 * leaving the id live would only risk a future mis-settle. From then on,
 * signals (2) and (4) are the only ones that can close the row.
 *
 * A settled row can never be resurrected by REPLAYED history. Every row
 * records a `replayFloor` — the source file's size at the moment its
 * `FileState` was created: for a rehydrated row (reattach/boot) that's the
 * file's size as of THAT attach; for a row that is BORN settled (a workflow
 * agent discovered under an already-settled container — see W7 below) it's
 * the file's size at the moment of discovery, not 0, precisely because such a
 * row already has "history" (its own never-before-tailed content) that must
 * not be mistaken for a live resume; a genuinely freshly-discovered RUNNING
 * file gets floor 0, since nothing about it has been read yet, let alone
 * settled. `tailFile`'s resume-detection (the "flip back to running" block)
 * only fires for a batch whose *starting* offset is at or beyond that floor;
 * bytes below the floor are replayed history — read again on every
 * attach/reattach from offset 0 — and must never flip a settled row back to
 * running, retire its `toolUseId`, or re-emit a `started` lifecycle, even
 * though those same bytes still flow through the mapper (persist/emit) and
 * still latch `sawEndOfTurn` like any other unseen line. A workflow agent row
 * additionally can never flip back while its CONTAINER is settled, regardless
 * of the floor — the cascade invariant ("nothing under a settled container
 * runs") holds at every tick, not just at discovery.
 *
 * A row settled via an AUTHORITATIVE receipt (a `<task-notification>` or a
 * journal `result` line — `receiptSettled` on the `FileState`) is even harder
 * to resurrect than an ordinary (`inferred`, e.g. `checkDone`/`checkStale`/a
 * real `tool_result`) settle: once receipt-settled, only a genuinely new `user`
 * line (a fresh prompt to a resumed agent) can flip it back to running —
 * trailing `assistant`/`attachment` lines flushed after the receipt cannot,
 * since the harness receipt is authoritative and claude never continues a
 * finished agent without a new user turn. An inferred settle of a fresh
 * in-session row stays flippable by ANY unseen line beyond the floor, by
 * design — `checkStale`'s self-correction (a falsely-stale row resuming)
 * depends on that looseness.
 *
 * ── Workflows (`/workflow`) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Workflow is claude's multi-agent orchestration tool. It is ALWAYS launched
 * in the background (its tool_result is an immediate `async_launched` stub), so
 * without tracking it the parent turn ends and the card jumps to `review` while
 * the workflow is still churning. Its on-disk layout is a subdirectory of the
 * same `subagents/` dir above:
 *
 *   <sessionId>/subagents/workflows/<wf_runId>/
 *         agent-<agentId>.jsonl      ← per workflow-agent transcript (sidechain)
 *         agent-<agentId>.meta.json  ← { agentType: "workflow-subagent", spawnDepth, model }
 *         journal.jsonl              ← harness-written per-agent receipts
 *
 * We model a workflow as TWO kinds of `subagents` row:
 *   • one CONTAINER row (`parentKind: "workflow"`, id = the workflow's harness
 *     taskId, sourcePath = the transcript dir). It is `running` for the
 *     workflow's WHOLE lifetime — launch line → completion notification — which
 *     is what keeps the card held in `running` across the idle gaps *between*
 *     agent waves. Nothing tails it (a directory is not a transcript); it is
 *     deliberately never entered into the `files` map.
 *   • one AGENT row per `agent-*.jsonl` (`parentKind: "workflow_agent"`), tailed
 *     by the exact same machinery regular subagents use, so each renders as a
 *     read-only tab.
 *
 * Container settle signals: (1) the completion `<task-notification>` reaching
 * claude-tmux live (→ `settleSubagentById` via the orchestrator — that path
 * needs no code here, the row PK *is* the notification's `<task-id>`);
 * (2) this module's own main-JSONL scan matching that same notification — the
 * restart-safe backstop, since boot reconciliation arms only the watcher and no
 * tmux tailer; (3) the generic orphan paths. Agent rows settle on their own
 * end_turn idle, on a `journal.jsonl` `result` receipt (the harness receipt is
 * immune to the terminal-line flush loss that concurrent agents can hit — a
 * workflow runs up to ~10 at once), or by CASCADE when their container settles.
 *
 * This module is READ-ONLY w.r.t. the agent: it watches files and tails them.
 * It never spawns, signals, or tears down a tmux session — `detach()` only
 * closes fs watchers + the poll timer.
 *
 * The format is internal to claude and the docs warn it can change between
 * versions, so everything here is defensive (missing dir / meta / fields all
 * degrade gracefully) and gated behind AGETOR_TRACK_SUBAGENTS (default on),
 * with the workflow half additionally gated behind AGETOR_TRACK_WORKFLOWS
 * (default on, nested under the former — see `WORKFLOWS_ENABLED`).
 * A parse error on one subagent file can never affect the main stream — it is
 * isolated to that file's tail.

   * below keys on the STRUCTURAL `toolUseResult.status === "async_launched"`
   * marker, never the human-readable text (which is not a stable contract) —
   * and on a match, does NOT settle: it marks the row `isAsync` and retires

   * line is only treated as the launch stub for a given candidate `fs` when
   * `toolUseResult.agentId` is either absent OR equals `fs.subagentId` — the
   * stub's `agentId` field IS the subagent row's own id (verified live), so
   * this is the correlation key, not just the shape. A candidate that doesn't

   * COMPLETION notification detection — the restart-safe backstop, generalized

   * through claude-tmux's `<task-notification>` handler (`settleSubagentById`
   * by `<task-id>`, which IS the container PK, so that path needed no
   * changes); but after boot reconciliation only this watcher is armed — no
   * tmux tailer — so the same notification has to be recognised here too.
   * Both on-disk shapes (the `queue-operation` enqueue line and the synthetic
   * `user` message) embed the tag verbatim, so one regex covers both.
   *
   * Superseded rationale: earlier, a `<task-id>` naming a regular (non-
   * workflow) background subagent was deliberately left to "the existing
   * paths" — the reasoning being that claude-tmux's own live dispatch
   * (`fireBackgroundTaskSettled`) would catch it. That reasoning doesn't
   * survive a restart: claude-tmux's dispatch is one-shot and dedup'd, never
   * re-issued on reattach, so once the tmux tailer that originally would have
   * seen it is gone, NOTHING settles that row's live notification ever again
   * — this scan is the only restart-safe path left for an async agent. It is
   * now safe to widen the match to `files` (ordinary tracked rows) as well as
   * `workflows` (containers): with W1's replay floor in place, a settle this
   * scan performs can no longer be undone by a later replay resurrecting the
   * row, which is what made the old narrower scope a deliberate, necessary
   * caution rather than an oversight.
   *
   * Only ids this watcher already tracks as `running` — container OR regular
   * row — are settled; an unrelated id is left alone.
   *
   * BOTH tags are required in the prefilter, not just `<task-id>`: settling a
   * row here is otherwise irreversible in the same tick (a later launch line
   * for a known container id early-returns in `registerWorkflowContainer`),
   * so a line that merely mentions a task id — an assistant message quoting a
   * notification back, a future launch blurb embedding the tag — must not be
   * enough to release the hold. Requiring the enclosing `<task-notification>`
   * marker, which both real on-disk shapes carry verbatim, keeps the match
   * anchored to an actual notification payload.
   *
   * Fix 9 — the notification's `<status>` is now parsed when present:
   * `completed`, `failed`, `killed` and `stopped` all mean "this agent/
   * workflow is over" and settle as before (plan assumption A4, extended to
   * regular rows by the same logic); an UNKNOWN status value is treated
   * conservatively — skip the settle and log once, rather than guess, since a
   * future claude release could introduce a non-terminal status this code
   * doesn't know about yet; an ABSENT `<status>` tag still settles
   * unconditionally, preserving back-compat with on-disk shapes (and older
   * fixture lines) that never carried one.
   *
   * Settles performed here pass `source: "receipt"` (fix 4) to
   * `settleSubagentById` — this scan only ever fires on an actual
   * `<task-notification>` payload, the harness's own authoritative
   * completion receipt, so a row it settles should resist resurrection by a

 * completion receipt (a `<task-notification>`, live via claude-tmux's
 * `setBackgroundTaskSettledHandler` wiring in orchestrator.ts, or restart-safe
 * via `scanLineForTaskNotification`/`tailJournals`'s journal `result` line);
