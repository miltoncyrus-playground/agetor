 * Background / sub-agent tracking.
 *
 * When a claude task spawns a sub-agent (the Agent/Task tool — Explore,
 * general-purpose, …, whether synchronous or run-in-background), claude writes
 * that agent's FULL transcript to its own sidechain file, a sibling of the main
 * session JSONL we already tail:
 *
 *   ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl            ← main stream
 *   ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>/subagents/
 *         agent-<agentId>.jsonl      ← per-subagent transcript (isSidechain:true)
 *         agent-<agentId>.meta.json  ← { agentType, description, toolUseId, spawnDepth }
 *
 * The `<sessionId>/subagents/` dir is created lazily — it only exists once a
 * sub-agent has run. We watch it, tail each `agent-*.jsonl` with the SAME
 * mapper the main stream uses (`mapJsonlEventToChunks`), and persist/emit each
 * event tagged with the subagent's id so the run panel can render a read-only
 * per-subagent tab. The main session JSONL still shows the launching `Agent`
 * tool-use card; the tab is the drill-in.
 *
 * A `running` row settles via one of FOUR signals, in rough order of how
 * often each fires: (1) the subagent's own file reaching an assistant
 * `stop_reason:"end_turn"` line and then going idle for `DONE_IDLE_MS`
 * (`checkDone` below); (2) a `<task-notification>` for it landing in the MAIN
 * session JSONL — this covers BOTH workflow containers AND ordinary
 * async/background subagent rows (`scanLineForTaskNotification` below; live
 * dispatch of the same notification via claude-tmux's `fireBackgroundTaskSettled`
 * is one-shot and never re-dispatched on reattach, so once the tmux tailer is
 * gone this scan is the only restart-safe path left for an async agent); (3)
 * this module's own scan of the MAIN session JSONL for a `tool_result` block
 * whose `tool_use_id` matches a tracked subagent's `toolUseId`
 * (`scanLineForToolResult` below) — the fallback for a *synchronous*
 * top-level subagent whose own file never gets a terminal end_turn line (a
 * flush loss under concurrent subagents) and which gets no task-notification
 * either; (4) a terminal staleness backstop (`checkStale` below) that settles
 * a `running` row with no `sawEndOfTurn` and no newly-appended bytes for
 * `STALE_SUBAGENT_SETTLE_MS` — the last resort for a row whose transcript
 * lost its end_turn AND whose one-shot receipt (2)/(3) is gone or was never
 * written. All four funnel through `settleSubagentById` so the DB write /
 * lifecycle emit / hold-release bookkeeping only lives in one place.
 *
 * Signal (3) has a stub guard in front of it: an ASYNC agent's `tool_result`
 * is an *immediate* launch acknowledgement (`toolUseResult.status ===
 * "async_launched"`), not a real completion. `scanLineForToolResult` detects
 * that shape and, instead of settling, marks the row `isAsync` and retires
 * its `toolUseId` — a real `tool_result` never arrives for an async agent, so
 * leaving the id live would only risk a future mis-settle. From then on,
 * signals (2) and (4) are the only ones that can close the row.
 *
 * A settled row can never be resurrected by REPLAYED history. Every row
 * records a `replayFloor` — the source file's size at the moment its
 * `FileState` was created: for a rehydrated row (reattach/boot) that's the
 * file's size as of THAT attach; for a row that is BORN settled (a workflow
 * agent discovered under an already-settled container — see W7 below) it's
 * the file's size at the moment of discovery, not 0, precisely because such a
 * row already has "history" (its own never-before-tailed content) that must
 * not be mistaken for a live resume; a genuinely freshly-discovered RUNNING
 * file gets floor 0, since nothing about it has been read yet, let alone
 * settled. `tailFile`'s resume-detection (the "flip back to running" block)
 * only fires for a batch whose *starting* offset is at or beyond that floor;
 * bytes below the floor are replayed history — read again on every
 * attach/reattach from offset 0 — and must never flip a settled row back to
 * running, retire its `toolUseId`, or re-emit a `started` lifecycle, even
 * though those same bytes still flow through the mapper (persist/emit) and
 * still latch `sawEndOfTurn` like any other unseen line. A workflow agent row
 * additionally can never flip back while its CONTAINER is settled, regardless
 * of the floor — the cascade invariant ("nothing under a settled container
 * runs") holds at every tick, not just at discovery.
 *
 * A row settled via an AUTHORITATIVE receipt (a `<task-notification>` or a
 * journal `result` line — `receiptSettled` on the `FileState`) is even harder
 * to resurrect than an ordinary (`inferred`, e.g. `checkDone`/`checkStale`/a
 * real `tool_result`) settle: once receipt-settled, only a genuinely new `user`
 * line (a fresh prompt to a resumed agent) can flip it back to running —
 * trailing `assistant`/`attachment` lines flushed after the receipt cannot,
 * since the harness receipt is authoritative and claude never continues a
 * finished agent without a new user turn. An inferred settle of a fresh
 * in-session row stays flippable by ANY unseen line beyond the floor, by
 * design — `checkStale`'s self-correction (a falsely-stale row resuming)
 * depends on that looseness.
 *
 * ── Workflows (`/workflow`) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Workflow is claude's multi-agent orchestration tool. It is ALWAYS launched
 * in the background (its tool_result is an immediate `async_launched` stub), so
 * without tracking it the parent turn ends and the card jumps to `review` while
 * the workflow is still churning. Its on-disk layout is a subdirectory of the
 * same `subagents/` dir above:
 *
 *   <sessionId>/subagents/workflows/<wf_runId>/
 *         agent-<agentId>.jsonl      ← per workflow-agent transcript (sidechain)
 *         agent-<agentId>.meta.json  ← { agentType: "workflow-subagent", spawnDepth, model }
 *         journal.jsonl              ← harness-written per-agent receipts
 *
 * We model a workflow as TWO kinds of `subagents` row:
 *   • one CONTAINER row (`parentKind: "workflow"`, id = the workflow's harness
 *     taskId, sourcePath = the transcript dir). It is `running` for the
 *     workflow's WHOLE lifetime — launch line → completion notification — which
 *     is what keeps the card held in `running` across the idle gaps *between*
 *     agent waves. Nothing tails it (a directory is not a transcript); it is
 *     deliberately never entered into the `files` map.
 *   • one AGENT row per `agent-*.jsonl` (`parentKind: "workflow_agent"`), tailed
 *     by the exact same machinery regular subagents use, so each renders as a
 *     read-only tab.
 *
 * Container settle signals: (1) the completion `<task-notification>` reaching
 * claude-tmux live (→ `settleSubagentById` via the orchestrator — that path
 * needs no code here, the row PK *is* the notification's `<task-id>`);
 * (2) this module's own main-JSONL scan matching that same notification — the
 * restart-safe backstop, since boot reconciliation arms only the watcher and no
 * tmux tailer; (3) the generic orphan paths. Agent rows settle on their own
 * end_turn idle, on a `journal.jsonl` `result` receipt (the harness receipt is
 * immune to the terminal-line flush loss that concurrent agents can hit — a
 * workflow runs up to ~10 at once), or by CASCADE when their container settles.
 *
 * ── Background shells (`Bash(run_in_background:true)`) ────────────────────
 *
 * A `Bash` tool call with `run_in_background: true` is claude's own shell-
 * backgrounding primitive — structurally unrelated to the Agent/Task/Workflow
 * tools above. The model fires off a long-running command (a build, an e2e
 * suite) and keeps working while it runs. There is no sidecar transcript file
 * and no `subagents/` dir entry at all — just an immediate stub `tool_result`
 * in the MAIN session JSONL naming a `backgroundTaskId`, and a raw
 * stdout+stderr redirect file at a path claude reports in that stub's
 * human-readable text. Without tracking it, `discover()`'s glob never sees
 * it, `subagents.hasRunning` never counts it, and the task releases to
 * `review` while the shell is still running.
 *
 * We model it as one `subagents` row (`parentKind: "bg_session"`,
 * `agentType: "shell"`, id = `backgroundTaskId`), built from a two-line
 * correlation over the MAIN session JSONL — an assistant `tool_use` line
 * remembered in a small pending map (`scanLineForBgShellLaunch`), then
 * matched against the immediate stub `tool_result` that names the
 * `backgroundTaskId` (`scanLineForBgShellStub`), both called from
 * `scanMainSignals` — rather than from any sidecar file, since there isn't
 * one. The row's `sourcePath` is the shell's output file, best-effort
 * regex-parsed from the stub's text (explicitly NOT a stable contract — a
 * parse miss still creates the row, just with no tab content; see
 * `scanLineForBgShellStub`). Live output tailing (`tailBgShells`) reads that
 * file raw and persists/emits it as a `stdout` stream tagged with the row's
 * id — there is no JSONL mapper involved, unlike every other stream in this
 * file.
 *
 * Settle signals, all funnelling through `settleSubagentById` like every
 * other row kind: (1) the completion `<task-notification>` — its `<task-id>`
 * IS the `backgroundTaskId`, so the existing LIVE orchestrator dispatch
 * (`setBackgroundTaskSettledHandler`) and the restart-safe
 * `scanLineForTaskNotification` scan both settle this row with ZERO changes
 * to their own id-matching logic, only a new lookup against `bgShells`
 * (review fix R2: that lookup also unconditionally latches `receiptSettled`,
 * even when the row was already ceiling-settled to `completed`, so a
 * trailing buffered flush after the harness's own authoritative receipt can
 * never resurrect it — see `scanLineForTaskNotification`'s bg-shell branch);
 * (2) a bounded ceiling (`checkBgShellCeiling`) — `(Bash timeout ?? a
 * default) + a margin` since the shell's LAST SIGN OF LIFE (review fix R1:
 * anchored on `lastAppendAt`, not the immutable `startedAt` — an anchor that
 * never moves would settle an actively-writing shell and then immediately
 * flip it back on the very next output batch, oscillating forever), settling
 * `completed` (inferred) if the notification never arrives, so a lost
 * receipt can never wedge the row `running` forever; a ceiling-settled
 * (never receipt-settled) row flips back to `running` if its output file
 * keeps growing afterwards, for at most one more margin window past the
 * settle (review fix R3 — see `checkBgShellCeiling`) — the same
 * bounce-rather-than-strand trade-off `checkStale` (W4) makes for file-backed
 * rows, applied here because the ceiling is itself only a guess. There is no
 * end-of-turn/staleness idle-detection for a bg shell (no transcript to go
 * idle by construction, so it is never entered into `files` and `checkStale`
 * never sees it) — the ceiling is its only backstop besides the notification
 * and the generic orphan paths, which cover it automatically (kind-agnostic).
 *
 * Gated behind `AGETOR_TRACK_BG_SHELLS`, nested under `ENABLED` exactly like
 * `WORKFLOWS_ENABLED` — see `BG_SHELLS_ENABLED`.
 *
 * ── Monitors (the `Monitor` tool) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A `Monitor` tool call is claude's own long-running-watch primitive — what
 * `/loop` and "watch this log" workflows use. The model arms a shell command
 * (`tail -f a build log`, `poll a CI run`) and gets notified on every event
 * the command produces, without polling or sleeping itself. Structurally it
 * is the closest existing kind to a background shell: no sidecar transcript
 * file, no `subagents/` dir entry — just two lines in the MAIN session
 * JSONL to correlate a launch, and a `<task-notification>` for every event
 * afterwards. Unlike a bg shell, though, a monitor's own notifications are
 * NOT a stub-then-done story: a monitor typically fires MANY notifications
 * over its life (one per event it observes) and only the LAST one is a
 * completion — every prior one is pure activity the card must stay `running`
 * through, not a receipt to settle on.
 *
 * Verified live shapes (claude-code 2.1.241):
 *   - Launch, half 1 — assistant `tool_use`:
 *       {"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"tool_use",
 *        "id":"toolu_01…","name":"Monitor","input":{"command":"tail -f …",
 *        "description":"serial re-run of 3 specs","timeout_ms":1500000,
 *        "persistent":false}}]}}
 *     `persistent:true` means no timeout — the monitor ends only via
 *     TaskStop.
 *   - Launch, half 2 — the immediate stub `tool_result`:
 *       {"type":"user","message":{"content":[{"tool_use_id":"toolu_01…",
 *        "type":"tool_result","content":"Monitor started (task bvkdtb50u,
 *        timeout 1500000ms). You will be notified on each event. Keep
 *        working — do not poll or sleep. …"}]},
 *        "toolUseResult":{"taskId":"bvkdtb50u","timeoutMs":1500000,
 *        "persistent":false},"timestamp":"2026-08-24T17:29:33.236Z"}
 *     The correlation key is `taskId` — NOT `backgroundTaskId` (bg shells)
 *     — and it is also the row PK / the `<task-id>` every later
 *     notification for this monitor carries.
 *   - Event — a `queue-operation`/`enqueue` line AND a synthetic `user` line
 *     tagged `origin.kind:"task-notification"` (the SAME dual-shape ordinary
 *     background-task notifications use), both carrying:
 *       <task-notification>
 *         <task-id>bvkdtb50u</task-id>
 *         <summary>Monitor event: "serial re-run of 3 specs"</summary>
 *         <event>Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed …</event>
 *       </task-notification>
 *     Critically, an ordinary event carries NO `<status>` tag — the presence
 *     of a `<status>` (or its absence) can't distinguish an event from a
 *     completion the way it does for every other notified kind.
 *   - Terminal (timeout) — the identical envelope with
 *     `<event>[Monitor timed out — re-arm if needed.]</event>`. A TaskStop'd
 *     monitor's exact shape is unverified — inferred to carry either a
 *     terminal `<status>` (the CLI's generic "was stopped" template) or
 *     another bracketed `[Monitor …]` event, hence `MONITOR_TERMINAL_EVENT_RE`
 *     recognising several verbs defensively, not just "timed out".
 *   - There is NO heartbeat line at all while a monitor is alive between
 *     events — a quiet monitor produces zero bytes anywhere this module can
 *     see, which is exactly why it needs its own ceiling (below) rather than
 *     the file-backed staleness backstop (`checkStale`) that assumes a
 *     transcript to go quiet.
 *
 * We model a monitor as one `subagents` row (`parentKind: "monitor"`,
 * `agentType: "monitor"`, id = the launch stub's `taskId`), tracked in its
 * OWN map (`monitors`, a `MonitorState` — deliberately NOT a `FileState`,
 * mirroring `WorkflowState`/`BgShellState`'s "own map, never `files`"
 * posture: there is no transcript file to tail, so none of `FileState`'s
 * uuid-dedup/end_turn-detection/mapper machinery applies). Row creation is
 * the same two-line launch correlation the bg-shell half uses —
 * `scanLineForMonitorLaunch` (prefilters on `"name":"Monitor"`, remembers
 * `{description, timeoutMs, persistent}` under the tool_use id in a capped
 * pending map) then `scanLineForMonitorStub` (prefilters on `"taskId"` +
 * `Monitor started`, correlates via the enclosing `tool_use_id`, inserts the
 * row) — both called from `scanMainSignals` alongside the bg-shell scans.
 *
 * The ONE monitor-specific piece of logic is the receipt rule
 * (`applyMonitorNotification`, plus its DB-only twin
 * `applyMonitorNotificationForRow` for a watcher-less task): a notification
 * naming a tracked monitor is TERMINAL iff its `<status>` is one of
 * `TERMINAL_NOTIFICATION_STATUSES` OR its `<event>` text (trimmed) matches
 * `MONITOR_TERMINAL_EVENT_RE` — a both-ends-anchored match against the
 * verified live shape (`[Monitor timed out — re-arm if needed.]`), not a
 * prefix match, so an ordinary event that merely STARTS with bracketed
 * status-looking text can't be misread as terminal (code review finding #2).
 * Anything else is ACTIVITY, not completion. Terminal settles the row
 * exactly like every other kind (`settleSubagentById(id, "completed",
 * "receipt")`, latching `receiptSettled` first — same unconditional-latch
 * posture bg shells use, see review fix R2 in
 * `scanLineForTaskNotification`'s doc — so a ceiling-settled row can never be
 * resurrected by a stray trailing receipt). Activity bumps `lastActivityAt`,
 * persists+emits the `<event>` text as a `stdout` line on the monitor's own
 * tab (dedup key `monitor:<id>:<fnv1aHex(block)>[:<bucket>]` for an ordinary
 * event, `monitor:<id>:terminal:<fnv1aHex(block)>` for a terminal one — see
 * `persistMonitorEvent`'s doc for the `terminal:` marker's purpose (finding
 * #3) and the timestamp-bucket's (finding #5); a content hash, not an
 * offset, because the SAME event legitimately arrives via two adjacent
 * lines — the `queue-operation` enqueue and the `user`/origin line — in one
 * scan pass, not just across a restart replay), and flips a ceiling-settled
 * (never receipt-settled) row back to `running`, mirroring
 * `checkBgShellCeiling`'s flip-back for the same "the ceiling was only a
 * guess" reason — ALSO discarding the row's own `timeoutMs`/`persistent`
 * (code review finding #1(b)) so it falls to the activity-anchored ceiling
 * rule from here on, exactly like a rehydrated row; see `checkMonitorCeiling`
 * below for why that matters.
 *
 * `checkMonitorCeiling` is the bounded-hold half: a monitor has no file to
 * grow, so its ceiling has no growth-watch counterpart to
 * `checkBgShellCeiling`'s — flip-back happens ONLY through
 * `applyMonitorNotification` reacting to a later event, never a per-tick
 * `statSync`. A timed monitor (`persistent === false`, `timeoutMs` known)
 * settles once its deadline has passed AND it has additionally gone quiet
 * for a margin (`now > startedAt + timeoutMs + MONITOR_TIMEOUT_MARGIN_MS &&
 * now - lastActivityAt > MONITOR_TIMEOUT_MARGIN_MS`) — claude itself kills
 * the monitor at its own deadline, so this only fires when that
 * termination's notification is lost. The silence requirement (code review
 * finding #1(a)) exists alongside the flip-back's `timeoutMs` reset above
 * for a reason: the deadline half of the check is otherwise IMMUTABLE, so
 * without BOTH fixes together, the very next tick after a flip-back would
 * immediately re-settle the row right back (the deadline is still in the
 * past) — an oscillation, not a one-time false settle. A persistent
 * monitor, or one rehydrated after a restart or flipped back from a ceiling
 * settle (`timeoutMs`/`persistent` are in-memory only, never persisted — a
 * reattached OR flipped-back row always falls into this branch), settles
 * once `now - lastActivityAt > MONITOR_DEFAULT_STALE_MS` — the same
 * activity-anchored staleness posture `checkStale`/`checkBgShellCeiling`
 * both use, since a persistent monitor's lifetime legitimately spans long
 * idle gaps between events with no other terminal signal besides TaskStop.
 *
 * Live dispatch (`handleBackgroundTaskNotification`, the module export the
 * orchestrator's `setBackgroundTaskSettledHandler` wiring calls in place of
 * `settleSubagentById` directly) routes a notification to the task's
 * attached watcher's own `applyMonitorNotification` when it already tracks
 * the id as a monitor — the cheapest, most in-sync path — and only falls
 * back to the DB-only `applyMonitorNotificationForRow` when no watcher
 * knows the id yet (a spawn/first-notification race, or a genuine gap in
 * coverage). A watcher that's attached but tracks NO monitors at all skips
 * even the DB lookup (`hasAnyMonitor()`, code review finding #8) — cheaper
 * than probing for an id that structurally cannot be a monitor row for this
 * task. Every OTHER id — the overwhelming majority, since only monitors get
 * this treatment — keeps today's exact behavior: `settleSubagentById(id,
 * "completed", "receipt")` unconditionally, since a notification for a
 * subagent/workflow/bg-shell row IS always terminal.
 *
 * Rehydration routes a `parentKind === "monitor"` DB row into `monitors`
 * (never `files`), seeding `lastActivityAt` to the rehydration timestamp. Its
 * flip-back gate (`ceilingSettled`/`receiptSettled`) is derived from what's
 * actually on record in `run_events`, not just the DB `status` column (code
 * review finding #3(b)): a `monitor:<id>:terminal:*` line_uuid on record
 * means an AUTHORITATIVE receipt closed this row (`receiptSettled: true`,
 * never flips back); its absence on an otherwise-`completed` row means only
 * `checkMonitorCeiling`'s GUESS closed it (`ceilingSettled: true`, flip-back
 * gate stays open) — see `attachSubagentWatcher`'s `parentKind === "monitor"`
 * branch. This is what makes flip-back survive a restart: the guarantee is
 * precisely "a REPLAYED line (already in `run_events`, by its dedup key)
 * never flips a row back, on ANY path; a genuinely NEW non-terminal event
 * DOES flip it back — whether or not a watcher is attached, and whether or
 * not agetor has restarted since the row was settled" (code review finding
 * #3, all three sub-parts together: the `terminal:` line_uuid marker, this
 * rehydration derivation, and `applyMonitorNotificationForRow`'s own
 * watcher-less flip-back for the no-watcher-attached case).
 *
 * Gated behind `AGETOR_TRACK_MONITORS`, nested under `ENABLED` exactly like
 * `BG_SHELLS_ENABLED`/`WORKFLOWS_ENABLED` — see `MONITORS_ENABLED`.
 *
 * This module is READ-ONLY w.r.t. the agent: it watches files and tails them.
 * It never spawns, signals, or tears down a tmux session — `detach()` only
 * closes fs watchers + the poll timer.
 *
 * The format is internal to claude and the docs warn it can change between
 * versions, so everything here is defensive (missing dir / meta / fields all
 * degrade gracefully) and gated behind AGETOR_TRACK_SUBAGENTS (default on),
 * with the workflow half additionally gated behind AGETOR_TRACK_WORKFLOWS,
 * the bg-shell half behind AGETOR_TRACK_BG_SHELLS, and the monitor half
 * behind AGETOR_TRACK_MONITORS (all default on, nested under the former —
 * see `WORKFLOWS_ENABLED` / `BG_SHELLS_ENABLED` / `MONITORS_ENABLED`).
 * A parse error on one subagent file can never affect the main stream — it is
 * isolated to that file's tail.

 *  `attachSubagentWatcher`) tell "this row's flip-back gate should be OPEN
 *  (settled only by the ceiling's guess)" from "CLOSED (settled by an
 *  authoritative receipt)" purely from `run_events` — no DB column needed —
 *  after a restart has thrown away the in-memory `receiptSettled` flag.
 *
 *  Finding #5 (code review) — an ORDINARY event's key additionally buckets
 *  by `lineTimestampMs` (the JSONL line's own `timestamp`, 10s granularity:
 *  `Math.floor(lineTimestampMs / 10_000)`) rather than hashing the block's
 *  text alone. A pure content-hash key (the original design) collapses TWO
 *  genuinely distinct occurrences of byte-identical event text (a monitored
 *  command legitimately reporting the exact same line twice, e.g. two
 *  consecutive `0 failed, 12 passed` heartbeats from a flaky watch loop)
 *  into one persisted row — silently dropping real activity. Bucketing lets
 *  a repeat more than ~10s later persist as its own row while still
 *  collapsing the SAME event's two adjacent lines (the `queue-operation`
 *  enqueue and the synthetic `user`/origin twin, which land within
 *  milliseconds of each other and so always share a bucket). Accepted
 *  trade-off, spelled out because it's asymmetric: an identical event
 *  repeated WITHIN the same 10s bucket still collapses to one row (rare
 *  enough at monitor-event cadence not to matter), and a twin whose two
 *  lines straddle a bucket boundary (a few-ms race right at a boundary)
 *  yields a harmless DUPLICATE line instead of collapsing — judged better
 *  than the alternative (a real repeat silently vanishing). Falls back to
 *  the hash-only key when `lineTimestampMs` is absent/unparseable
 *  (`undefined`/`null`). Both paths normally supply it — the restart-safe
 *  scan via `extractLineTimestampMs`, the live dispatch via the parsed
 *  line's own `timestamp` that claude-tmux forwards through
 *  `handleBackgroundTaskNotification` — which is what keeps the two paths

 *     or otherwise-closed row stays closed, exactly as the rehydration
 *     branch treats those statuses; (1) this row has no authoritative
 *     terminal receipt already on record (a `monitor:<id>:terminal:*`
 *     line_uuid — mirrors `applyMonitorNotification`'s `!m.receiptSettled`
 *     gate: a receipt-settled row never resurrects, only a ceiling-settled
 *     one does), and (2) `persistMonitorEvent` reports this event as
 *     genuinely NEW (its `true` return) — a REPLAYED (already-persisted)

   * Live output tailing for `running` background shells — the counterpart to
   * `tailFile` for a raw stdout/stderr redirect instead of a JSONL transcript
   * (see the module header's "Background shells" section). No mapper, no
   * line-level parsing, no per-line dedup: `readAppendedSync` hands back
   * whatever new bytes exist and they're persisted/emitted verbatim as ONE
   * `stdout` event per batch — mirrors `tailFile`'s persist/emit idiom
   * exactly (`runs.appendEvent` + the matching `emitFn` call, both taskId-
   * tagged).
   *
   * `line_uuid = "bgshell:<id>:<batchStartOffset>"` — the batch's starting
   * offset is a stable, monotonically-increasing key per shell, so a
   * duplicate emit of the same batch (should this ever run twice for the
   * same bytes) is deduped by the `(run_id, line_uuid)` partial unique index
   * exactly like every other persisted stream.
   *
   * Skips a shell with no known `outputPath` (the best-effort parse in
   * `scanLineForBgShellStub` missed) — its row still holds the task, it just
   * has no live tab content. `readAppendedSync` itself never throws (ENOENT/
   * stat errors degrade to "nothing appended"), so this needs no try/catch of
   * its own.
   *
   * Review fix R4 — each read is capped at `BG_SHELL_BATCH_MAX_BYTES`; a
   * shell that outpaces the cap simply drains over more ticks (`b.offset`
   * only advances by what was actually read, so nothing is skipped, only
   * deferred). A batch that lands mid multi-byte UTF-8 sequence renders that
   * one boundary byte-run as the `�` replacement character in this
   * batch's text — a cosmetic, self-healing artifact (the next batch's bytes
   * are unaffected), accepted the same way this file already accepts
   * `tailFile`'s "a batch straddling the replay floor is conservatively
   * treated as replay for one extra tick" trade-off.

   * Third settle signal (see module header): match one MAIN-session-JSONL line
   * against the `tool_result` blocks whose `tool_use_id` equals a tracked
   * `running` subagent's `toolUseId` — the fallback for a synchronous
   * top-level subagent whose own transcript never gets a terminal end_turn
   * line and gets no task-notification either (see claude-tmux.ts's
   * `fireBackgroundTaskSettled` for that other path). A subagent discovered
   * AFTER the offset has already advanced past its tool_result (a
   * readdir-visibility race while a sibling kept the scan running) is covered
   * by `discover()` rewinding `mainOffset` to 0 for one full rescan — settles
   * are idempotent, so re-reading old lines is harmless.
   *
   * W2 — async-stub guard. When `Agent(run_in_background: true)` launches a
   * subagent, claude writes an IMMEDIATE `tool_result` for the launching
   * `tool_use` whose `toolUseResult` is `{ isAsync:true,
   * status:"async_launched", agentId, … }` — not a completion, just an
   * acknowledgement that the background agent started. Ground truth verified
   * live: `{"type":"user","message":{...content:[{type:"tool_result",
   * tool_use_id,...}]},"toolUseResult":{"isAsync":true,
   * "status":"async_launched","agentId":"...",...}}`. This function has no
   * stub guard prior to W2 — every `running` row whose `toolUseId` happens to
   * match is settled `completed` on this stub alone, while the agent is still
   * working (the false-settle root-caused as D1 in the plan doc). The guard
   * below keys on the STRUCTURAL `toolUseResult.status === "async_launched"`
   * marker, never the human-readable text (which is not a stable contract) —
   * and on a match, does NOT settle: it marks the row `isAsync` and retires
   * its `toolUseId` instead, since a REAL `tool_result` will never arrive for
   * an async agent (retiring prevents the stub — or a resend of it on replay
   * — from ever being mis-read as a completion again). From there the row's
   * only remaining settle paths are the task-notification backstop (W3) and
   * the staleness backstop (W4).
   *
   * Fix 5 — the stub guard is now CORRELATED per candidate, not just derived
   * once for the whole line: a `toolUseResult.status === "async_launched"`
   * line is only treated as the launch stub for a given candidate `fs` when
   * `toolUseResult.agentId` is either absent OR equals `fs.subagentId` — the
   * stub's `agentId` field IS the subagent row's own id (verified live), so
   * this is the correlation key, not just the shape. A candidate that doesn't
   * match (a coincidental substring hit for a DIFFERENT agent's stub sharing
   * this batch) falls through to normal settle handling instead of being
   * wrongly marked async.

  /**
   * COMPLETION notification detection — the restart-safe backstop, generalized
   * (W3) beyond just workflow containers. A live session settles a container
   * through claude-tmux's `<task-notification>` handler (`settleSubagentById`
   * by `<task-id>`, which IS the container PK, so that path needed no
   * changes); but after boot reconciliation only this watcher is armed — no
   * tmux tailer — so the same notification has to be recognised here too.
   * Both on-disk shapes (the `queue-operation` enqueue line and the synthetic
   * `user` message) embed the tag verbatim, so one regex covers both.
   *
   * Superseded rationale: earlier, a `<task-id>` naming a regular (non-
   * workflow) background subagent was deliberately left to "the existing
   * paths" — the reasoning being that claude-tmux's own live dispatch
   * (`fireBackgroundTaskSettled`) would catch it. That reasoning doesn't
   * survive a restart: claude-tmux's dispatch is one-shot and dedup'd, never
   * re-issued on reattach, so once the tmux tailer that originally would have
   * seen it is gone, NOTHING settles that row's live notification ever again
   * — this scan is the only restart-safe path left for an async agent. It is
   * now safe to widen the match to `files` (ordinary tracked rows) as well as
   * `workflows` (containers): with W1's replay floor in place, a settle this
   * scan performs can no longer be undone by a later replay resurrecting the
   * row, which is what made the old narrower scope a deliberate, necessary
   * caution rather than an oversight.
   *
   * Only ids this watcher already tracks as `running` — container OR regular
   * row — are settled; an unrelated id is left alone.
   *
   * BOTH tags are required in the prefilter, not just `<task-id>`: settling a
   * row here is otherwise irreversible in the same tick (a later launch line
   * for a known container id early-returns in `registerWorkflowContainer`),
   * so a line that merely mentions a task id — an assistant message quoting a
   * notification back, a future launch blurb embedding the tag — must not be
   * enough to release the hold. Requiring the enclosing `<task-notification>`
   * marker, which both real on-disk shapes carry verbatim, keeps the match
   * anchored to an actual notification payload.
   *
   * Fix 9 — the notification's `<status>` is now parsed when present:
   * `completed`, `failed`, `killed` and `stopped` all mean "this agent/
   * workflow is over" and settle as before (plan assumption A4, extended to
   * regular rows by the same logic); an UNKNOWN status value is treated
   * conservatively — skip the settle and log once, rather than guess, since a
   * future claude release could introduce a non-terminal status this code
   * doesn't know about yet; an ABSENT `<status>` tag still settles
   * unconditionally, preserving back-compat with on-disk shapes (and older
   * fixture lines) that never carried one.
   *
   * Settles performed here pass `source: "receipt"` (fix 4) to
   * `settleSubagentById` — this scan only ever fires on an actual
   * `<task-notification>` payload, the harness's own authoritative
   * completion receipt, so a row it settles should resist resurrection by a
   * trailing non-`user` line the way an inferred (`checkDone`/`checkStale`/
   * real-`tool_result`) settle does not.
   *
   * Finding #4 (code review) — the `monitors` lookup and dispatch now runs
   * BEFORE the unknown-`<status>` guard, not after. A Monitor owns its own
   * complete terminal-vs-activity rule end-to-end
   * (`parseMonitorNotificationBlock`, which inspects `<status>` itself — see
   * the module header's "Monitors" section) and is the ONE kind here for
   * which an "unrecognised `<status>`" is not a reason to skip anything: fix
   * 9's guard below only makes sense for a kind whose ENTIRE settle decision
   * is "does `<status>` say terminal" — for those kinds, an unknown value is
   * correctly treated as "can't tell, don't guess". A Monitor's notification
   * envelope, by contrast, is defined to ALSO carry ordinary ACTIVITY (most
   * of its notifications aren't completions at all), so before this fix a
   * Monitor event whose `<status>` happened to be an unrecognised value (a
   * hypothetical future harness status this code doesn't know about yet, or
   * any garbage value) was silently DROPPED by the guard's `continue` —
   * never reaching `applyMonitorNotification` at all, so `lastActivityAt`
   * never advanced and the event was never persisted to the tab. Moving
   * monitors above the guard fixes this: they always reach their own rule,
   * and any `<status>` they can't interpret as terminal is correctly folded
   * into activity by `parseMonitorNotificationBlock` rather than discarded.
   * The guard itself is UNCHANGED for every other kind — workflow
   * containers, plain rows, and bg shells still skip (and log) on an
   * unrecognised `<status>` exactly as before.

   * names a real launch's pending entry, and leaving it behind wastes one of

   * Review fix R6 — on a coalesced user line carrying MULTIPLE tool_result
   * blocks (e.g. two backgrounded commands acknowledged in the same turn),
   * blindly taking the FIRST block risked correlating this stub against the
   * WRONG launch: wrong description/timeout pulled from `bgShellPending`,
   * the wrong pending entry deleted (stranding the real one), and the
   * output-path regex run over unrelated text. Now every tool_result block
   * is considered and the best match wins: prefer the block whose own
   * `content` string names THIS stub's `backgroundTaskId` (`id`, resolved
   * above) — the strongest signal, since claude's stub text always echoes
   * the id it just minted — then a block whose `tool_use_id` is a launch
   * this watcher is actually waiting on (`bgShellPending`); only when
   * neither matches (unexpected content shape, or the pending entry was
   * already lost) does it fall back to the first block, same as before this
   * fix.

   * Review fix R5 — `startedAt` (and the initial `lastAppendAt`) now prefer

   * One shared `mainOffset` cursor, one read, one split. The early return is
   * deliberately narrow: bailing on `pending.length === 0` (as this did when

   * NOTE — `scanLineForTaskNotification` runs whenever EITHER `WORKFLOWS_ENABLED`

   * 0` — no point scanning for a notification naming a row this watcher
   * hasn't created yet), even though it also backstops plain (non-workflow)
   * async subagents whenever workflows are on. That's a deliberate
   * scope-preserving choice, not an oversight: `WORKFLOWS_ENABLED` defaults
   * on, so this covers the overwhelming majority of installs unchanged; an
   * operator who explicitly sets `AGETOR_TRACK_WORKFLOWS=0` (with bg shells
   * also off, or none yet discovered) also loses the async-notification
   * backstop for ordinary subagents (they still have the end_turn-idle and
   * staleness backstops) — a narrower rollback lever was judged preferable to
   * adding a second independent env var for one scan.
   *
   * COST NOTE — tracking workflows OR bg shells means this watcher scans the
   * main transcript on every cycle, where before (neither tracked) it usually
   * skipped the read entirely. Two things keep that bounded: the first read
   * after attach starts at most `REPLAY_WINDOW_BYTES` from the end (see the
   * clamp in `attachSubagentWatcher`), and every read after it is incremental
   * — the cursor only ever moves forward, so steady state is one `statSync`
   * plus the handful of bytes the turn actually appended. The old "a task
   * with no background agents never pays for this scan at all" property
   * survives only with both `AGETOR_TRACK_WORKFLOWS=0` and

 * harmless no-op that returns `false` without emitting a second lifecycle
 * event or firing the settle hook again.
 *

 * completion receipt (a `<task-notification>`, live via claude-tmux's
 * `setBackgroundTaskSettledHandler` wiring in orchestrator.ts, or restart-safe
 * via `scanLineForTaskNotification`/`tailJournals`'s journal `result` line);
