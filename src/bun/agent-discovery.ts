 * was assumed to exist by a previous version of this function but never

 * it fails with `error: unexpected argument '--models'` on both, so
 * `discoverCodex` had always silently returned `[]`.
 *
 * Protocol (spike-verified, both versions, 2026-09-03):
 *   1. `{jsonrpc:"2.0", id, method:"initialize", params:{clientInfo}}` →
 *      response in ~160ms. Unsolicited notifications with no `id` (e.g.
 *      `remoteControl/status/changed`) may arrive interleaved — ignored.
 *   2. `{jsonrpc:"2.0", method:"initialized", params:{}}` — a notification,
 *      no `id`, no response expected.
 *   3. `{jsonrpc:"2.0", id, method:"model/list", params:{}}` → response in
 *      0.8–1.8s: `{id, result:{data:[...], nextCursor}}`. An unknown method
 *      would answer `{id, error:{code:-32600, message}}`.
 *
 * The catalog is account-scoped and server-fetched (codex caches it at
 * `~/.codex/models_cache.json`), which is exactly why this can't be a
 * one-shot `runProbe` subcommand call the way cursor/fx's discoverers are —
 * it's a stateful handshake over a long-lived pipe, not a single argv probe.
 *
 * `env`, when given, is merged over `process.env` for this one spawn — same
 * convention (and same reason) as `runProbe`/`discoverFx`'s `env` parameter:
 * codex's catalog is account-scoped, so a second codex harness (its own
 * `home` → `HOME`+`CODEX_HOME` override via `harnessEnv`, see
 * `src/bun/agents.ts`) must be probed under *its own* env to see *its own*
 * account's catalog rather than the built-in harness's. `bin`, when given,
 * is used verbatim in place of the `AGETOR_CODEX_BIN ?? "codex"` /
 * `Bun.which` resolution below — mirrors `discoverFx`'s `bin` parameter and
 * `resolveBin`'s harness.bin-first resolution in `agents.ts`. Both are
 * optional and additive: every pre-existing no-args caller keeps probing the
 * built-in harness under agetor's own process env, exactly as before these
 * parameters existed.
 *
 * Contract, matching every other discoverer in this module: never throws,
 * never hangs. Resolves `[]` when: the child exits before the `model/list`
 * result arrives (the `/bin/echo app-server` unit-test stub case — this
 * resolves promptly on exit, it does not wait out the timeout budget below);
 * a response carries a JSON-RPC `error`; the timeout budget elapses; or
 * anything throws (including a `stdin.write`/`flush` against an
 * already-closed pipe, guarded individually since that stub case closes its
 * pipe immediately). The child is always killed and the timer always
 * cleared in a `finally`. Pagination follows a non-empty string
 * `nextCursor` with a fresh `model/list` call (`{cursor}`), bounded to 5
 * pages total, concatenating each page's `data` before handing the whole
 * batch to `parseCodexModelList` — UNLESS the timeout fired at any point
 * during that pagination (`timedOut`, set only by the timer callback): in
 * that case this resolves `[]` outright, discarding whatever pages had
 * already landed, rather than returning (and letting the caller cache +
 * publish) a partial catalog that would just flip back to the full one on
 * the next sweep. This is distinct from a genuine JSON-RPC `error` on
 * `model/list`, which is unaffected by the timeout flag: an error on the
 * FIRST page still resolves `[]` (nothing was collected yet to keep), but an
 * error on a LATER page keeps whatever earlier pages already landed — both
 * halves of that behavior are unchanged from before this fix, just spelled
 * out precisely here.
 *
 * Leak-safety: the background stdout reader is hoisted to this function's
 * scope (`reader`, assigned inside the read loop's own try) so the outer
 * `finally` can `reader.cancel()` it after `kill()`ing the direct child —
 * without this, a grandchild that inherited the same stdout pipe (a real
 * `codex app-server` may spawn MCP/helper children) keeps that pipe's write
 * end open from its side, the reader's `read()` never resolves `done`, and
 * this process never releases its own reference to the pipe — which is
 * exactly what keeps a `Bun.spawn`'d child's stdout stream, and therefore
 * agetor's own event loop, from ever going idle. Cancelling the reader (not
 * just killing the direct child) releases *this process's* end of the pipe
 * regardless of what a grandchild still holds open on its side. The read
 * loop's `getReader()` call itself is inside its own try (previously it sat
 * outside — a throw there was an unhandled rejection); every `await` in that
 * loop is covered by the same try/catch, which degrades to a silent no-op
 * on any stream error rather than rejecting into the void (the `exited`
 * handler already settles any pending calls independently). On a clean
 * `done` (the child closed stdout normally), a non-empty residual `buf` —
 * the tail of a reply that never got its own trailing newline — is run
 * through the same dispatch path before the loop exits, instead of being
 * silently discarded.
 *
 * Stays a leaf like every other discoverer here: no import of db.ts,
 * agents.ts, or any other process-spawning helper module — see the
 * module-level "stay a leaf" note on `discoverFx` below.

 * not Gateway-wide: an empty `HOME` sees 230 ids (every flagship, including
 * the premium tiers); a reference logged-in account sees 158 — a strict
 * subset missing exactly the premium tiers. Latency is 0.3–0.9 s either way,
 * well inside `runProbe`'s 3 s timeout.
 *
 * Re-measured against fx 0.0.7 (build cef08aa0f178, 2026-08-31): still zero
 * filesystem writes either way, and the unauth catalog grew to 234 ids
 * (still every flagship present); the 158-id signed-in reference could not
 * be re-checked this pass (expired local login token). New in 0.0.7 and
 * load-bearing for this account-scoping story: on an account whose login has
 * expired (`auth_expired: true`), a passive probe like this one does NOT
 * refresh the token — it silently falls back to the UNAUTHENTICATED catalog
 * rather than erroring or blocking, so a discovered list can quietly
 * over-show premium `catalogOnly` ids for a user whose session lapsed, until
 * they re-run `fx login`. There is no probe-side way to distinguish that
 * from a genuinely unauthenticated account; both read identically. The
 * pickers compensate for this at the merge layer: `mergeModelOptions`
 * (src/shared/model-options.ts) treats a harness whose `HarnessStatus.loggedIn
 * === false` as having no trustworthy discovered catalog, so `catalogOnly`
 * rows can't over-show from that degraded view.
 *
 * Re-verified against fx 0.0.8 (2026-09-08): still zero filesystem writes,
 * and the unauth catalog reads 244 ids TODAY on both the 0.0.7 and 0.0.8
 * binaries — confirming (per the `parseFxModels` doc comment above) that
 * this count tracks the Gateway's catalog on the day probed, not which
 * binary version is doing the probing. The expired-login degradation
 * (silent fallback to the unauthenticated catalog, indistinguishable from a
 * genuinely logged-out probe) still applies unchanged on 0.0.8; the
 * `mergeModelOptions` compensation described above is unaffected.
 *
 * Re-verified through fx 0.0.10 (2026-09-14): still zero filesystem writes,
 * and the unauth catalog reads 247 ids on 2026-09-14 — identical across the
 * 0.0.8, 0.0.9, and 0.0.10 binaries — reconfirming (per the `parseFxModels`
 * doc comment above) that this count tracks the Gateway's catalog on the
 * day probed, not which binary version is doing the probing. The
 * expired-login degradation (silent fallback to the unauthenticated
 * catalog, indistinguishable from a genuinely logged-out probe) still
 * applies unchanged on 0.0.9 and 0.0.10; the `mergeModelOptions`
 * compensation described above is unaffected.
 *
 * That account-scoping is exactly why `env` exists as a parameter here (and
 * threads through to `runProbe`): a harness with its own `HOME` override —
 * an additional-account fx harness — must be probed under *its own* env to
 * get *its own* account's catalog, not agetor's process env / the built-in
 * harness's account. Callers that omit `env` (the built-in fx harness, and
 * any caller that predates per-harness discovery) get exactly the prior
 * behavior: probed under agetor's own process env.
 *
 * The hardcoded `AGENT_OPTIONS.fx.models` stays the labeled/hinted curated
 * subset shown first in the picker; this discovered list merges with it the
 * same way the codex/cursor discovered lists merge with their own curated
 * arrays (nothing fx-specific to change on the UI side). No labels come back
 * from fx's CLI, so every discovered entry is `{id}` only — the picker falls
 * back to rendering the bare id, same as codex.
