/**
 * Typed `Task` fixture for CLI tests. Every required `Task` field is spelled
 * out on a value annotated `: Task`, so a rename or a newly-required field on
 * the shared interface fails `tsc` here instead of silently passing through a
 * fixture cast via `as unknown as Task` (review finding L-CLI13 — the old
 * per-file fixtures cast through `unknown`, so shape drift never surfaced).
 *
 * `over` is a `Partial<Task>` — also typed — so a test can't pass a field the
 * interface doesn't have either. Defaults are the cheapest honest shape: a
 * never-run, non-isolated task on a built-in harness.
