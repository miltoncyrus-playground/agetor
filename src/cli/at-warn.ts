 *    wizard's interactive prompt — never `--title`, which never holds prompt
 *    text) count.
 *    `restrictTo` of `null`/omitted applies no such filter.
 *
 * A raw token `findAtTokens` itself can't parse back into a token (e.g. a
 * bare `"@"` with nothing after it) is skipped rather than crashing — every
 * caller sources these from either the server's own tokenizer or a fresh
 * scan of the prompt, so this is a defensive no-op in practice, not a real
