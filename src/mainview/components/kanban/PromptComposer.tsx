/**
 * Shared prompt-composer block: the label row + Extensions picker, the
 * prompt `<Textarea>` with its `/` autocomplete and drag/paste-to-attach
 * wiring, and the References picker beneath it.
 *
 * Lifted **verbatim** out of `NewTaskForm.tsx` (its capabilities effect,
 * saved-prompts loader, `applyCaptured`/`reportCapture`/`onPromptPaste`
 * capture handlers, and the prompt-block JSX) — this module is the single
 * source of truth for that behavior now, consumed by four call sites:
 * `NewTaskForm`, `CreateTaskFromIssueDialog`, `ResolveConflictsDialog`, and
 * `RunPanel`'s send dock (via the layout slots below — `toolbar`/`actions`/
 * `notice`/`inputAdornment`/`trailing`/`hint`/`hintClassName`). There is no
 * separate copy left to keep in lockstep — this file is it.
 *
 * **The `capture` seam**: `usePromptCapture` needs a real, dispatch-shaped
 * (`Dispatch<SetStateAction<...>>`) prompt/references setter to safely
 * serialize two captures that land back-to-back across an async boundary
 * (see `applyCaptured` below). When the caller doesn't supply one, this
 * component derives a bridge from its `value`/`onChange` props, backed by a
 * ref that's refreshed on every render (see `valueRef`/`referencesRef`
 * below) — that keeps each individual functional-update call closure-safe
 * across an async boundary (e.g. one capture's `setPrompt((cur) => …)`
 * firing after a keystroke or a SlashAutocomplete/ExtensionPicker insertion
 * lands in between). What the bridge can't do is serialize *two* functional
 * updates dispatched in the same tick, before the parent has re-rendered and
 * refreshed the ref — only a real `useState` dispatcher does that. `NewTaskForm`
 * owns a full aside-wide drop zone (`onAsideDrop`) where two such
 * same-tick captures are a real scenario, so it builds its own
 * `usePromptCapture` from its actual `useState` dispatchers and passes the
 * result in via the `capture` prop, sharing the exact same drop-hint/caret
 * path the textarea's own paste handler uses. A dialog with no outer drop
 * zone has no such race in practice and can just let the composer own its
 * own internal instance.
 *
 * **The caret-before-focus rule**: any future code that inserts text into
 * the prompt textarea programmatically must call `setSelectionRange` (or
 * otherwise position the caret) *before* calling `.focus()`, never after —
 * `SlashAutocomplete` syncs its tracked caret off the native `focus` event,
 * so focusing first makes it read the stale pre-insert offset, which can
 * land inside a `/token`, pop the slash menu, and swallow the next Enter via
 * `preventDefault`. See `ExtensionPicker.tsx`'s `insertText` for the
 * canonical example of getting this right.
 *
 * **The `@` file-reference layer**: `fileScope` (a `{ dir, ref? }` pair — see
 * `useProjectFiles`/`FileScope`) tells this composer which project tree the
 * `@` popover (`AtFileAutocomplete`) lists and the in-field highlight
 * (`AtHighlightBackdrop`) validates against; `null`/omitted disables both
 * with no fetch. `AtHighlightBackdrop` must render as the FIRST child of the
 * textarea's `relative` wrapper — it paints highlight marks *behind* the
 * textarea's own text via DOM order, not z-index, so the textarea itself
 * needs `relative` (not just its wrapper) for that stacking to hold; a
 * static (non-positioned) textarea would let the absolutely-positioned
 * backdrop painted-later win instead. `AtFileAutocomplete` sits after
 * `SlashAutocomplete` in the same wrapper and shares its `placement`. The two
 * popovers coexist without fighting over the same keystroke because `/` only
 * triggers at BOF or after whitespace/a `@`-token boundary the same way `@`
 * does — `findActiveAtQuery`'s grammar excludes `/` from ever appearing
 * inside an open `@` slice, so an `@src/` query never pops the slash menu.
 */

/**
 * Fetches the `/` autocomplete commands and Extensions-picker entries
 * reachable for a given agent, scoped by the SAME `{ dir, ref? }` pair the
 * `@` file popover already derives per surface (`FileScope` from
 * `use-project-files`) — lifted from `NewTaskForm`'s identical effect
 * verbatim, then rekeyed off `scope` instead of a separate `workdir`/`branch`
 * pair so every composer shares one derivation and can't drift from the `@`
 * listing's rule: `{dir}` for a live tree (an existing worktree, or an
 * isolation=none workdir) reads the working copy on disk; `{dir, ref}` for a
 * not-yet-created worktree reads project-level skills/commands/MCP at the
 * pinned ref — what the worktree will actually contain once it exists;
 * `null`/undefined `scope` (or a blank `scope.dir`) short-circuits to empty
 * lists without a fetch. A failed fetch also resolves to empty lists (no
 * autocomplete is no worse than none).
 *
 * `opts.enabled` (default `true`) lets a caller that hoists this hook above
 * a conditionally-mounted `PromptComposer` skip the disk walk entirely when
 * the composer's own internal call would otherwise be idle — see
 * `PromptComposerProps.capabilities`'s doc for why that hoisting exists.
 * `enabled: false` never fetches and reports back `{ commands: [],
 * extensions: [] }`.

  // `relative` anchors SlashAutocomplete's/AtFileAutocomplete's popovers to

  // not z-index, is what puts its marks behind the textarea's real text —
  // see the file header) and the `Textarea` itself needs `relative` too, so
  // it — a later, *positioned* sibling — wins the paint order over the
  // earlier, absolutely-positioned backdrop.
  // Both the backdrop and the popover are gated on `fileScope` being
  // non-null — a composer with no scope (no `@` project tree resolved yet)
  // must cost nothing per keystroke: no `getComputedStyle` reads, no
  // highlight re-segmenting, no popover-query recompute. `useProjectFiles`
  // itself stays an unconditional hook call above (hooks can't be
  // conditional) but already short-circuits to empty results with no fetch
  // when `fileScope` is nullish, so gating only the JSX here is sufficient —
  // `projectFiles.entries`/`.validPaths` are just `[]`/`new Set()` in that
  // case and these two components would render as no-ops anyway, but never
  // mounting them at all is what actually removes their per-keystroke work
  // (see AtHighlightBackdrop's/AtFileAutocomplete's own layout-effect and
  // memo costs).

  // --- Unresolved `@` reference warning -----------------------------------
  // Send-time expansion (orchestrator `startTask`/`sendInput`) silently
  // leaves unresolvable tokens verbatim — the agent just receives literal
  // `@`-text. The unhighlighted state is the only passive signal, so this
  // warns actively while the draft holds a token that won't become a path.
  // Verdict layering, cheapest first:
  //   1. listing membership — same oracle as the highlight backdrop;
  //   2. known `@name` extension mentions (the ExtensionPicker's own insert
  //      syntax, e.g. `@github`) are never file references → never warned;
  //   3. LIVE scopes only (no `ref`): a debounced `/refs/resolve` stat
  //      rescues paths that exist on disk but aren't listed (gitignored
  //      `@.env`) — send-time expansion WILL resolve those, so warning
  //      would lie. Ref scopes skip the stat: a fresh worktree at the
  //      pinned ref contains exactly the listing, so listing = truth.
  //   4. TRUNCATED scopes (the base listing hit the 20k `MAX_PROJECT_FILES`
  //      cap, e.g. a monorepo): the capped listing can't prove a token
  //      unresolved on its own, so a token missing from it is neither warned
  //      NOR cleared until a debounced server-side full-depth search
  //      (`searchProjectFiles`, `GET /files/index?q=`) checks that ONE token
  //      by name — found → treated as listed (folded into `verifiedListed`,
  //      and the exact matched entry path is unioned into the highlight
  //      backdrop's `validPaths` via `verifiedEntryPaths` so it highlights
  //      too, same as step 1); confirmed absent from the full listing →
  //      recorded in `checkedMissing`, the only tokens allowed to warn while
  //      truncated. An unproven token (not checked yet, or the check is
  //      still in flight) never warns — that per-token guarantee is what
  //      replaces the old blanket "suppress the whole warning while
  //      truncated" behavior; non-truncated scopes never populate
  //      `checkedMissing`, so this step is a no-op for them.
