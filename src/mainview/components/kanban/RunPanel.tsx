  // Two complementary pin-to-bottom paths, both gated on `nearBottomRef` so
  // a user who scrolled up to read history is never yanked back down:
  //   1. On every event / rebuild / interaction change, scroll once as a
  //      layout effect — pre-paint, before the browser gets a chance to
  //      dispatch any scroll event of its own. This is the cheap backstop:
  //      it only fires on the dependencies listed below, so it covers
  //      commits that change content without changing either box the
  //      ResizeObserver watches, and it also recovers any pin that path 2
  //      skipped under the suppression window (see below) once the next
  //      real growth or a dependency change comes through. Running
  //      pre-paint (not as a passive effect) matters most on a violent
  //      commit — e.g. the live→rebuilt `displayedEvents` swap, where every
  //      event's key changes and the whole transcript remounts. The two
  //      changes here are jointly, not independently, sufficient:
  //      `[overflow-anchor:none]` (see the container's className comment)
  //      removes native anchoring as a competing `scrollTop` writer — left
  //      enabled, it runs during layout, which happens AFTER layout
  //      effects, so even with the pin converted to `useLayoutEffect` an
  //      anchoring-driven jump would still land after the pin and override
  //      it. The layout-effect conversion, in turn, closes the remaining
  //      window where a same-frame scroll event could latch `nearBottomRef`
  //      false before the pin gets a chance to read it. With both in place,
  //      the pin runs while `nearBottomRef` still holds its pre-commit
  //      value, and no post-effect scroll adjustment is left that could
  //      latch it false first.
  //   2. A ResizeObserver on both the scroll container (`logRef`) and the
  //      content wrapper (`logContentRef`) below. The container's own box
  //      shrinks when something mounts above it in the flex column —
  //      `SubagentTabs` or a terminal tab strip resolving from an async
  //      list fetch — which otherwise leaves the log short with no event to
  //      hook. The content wrapper's height grows asynchronously for
  //      reasons invisible to path 1's dependency list: replay-buffer
  //      flushes landing on their own timer, markdown/code block layout
  //      settling after mount, and a `UserMessageBlock`'s "Show more"
  //      toggle appearing once it measures itself. Observing both, rather
  //      than enumerating every async cause as a dependency, makes the pin
  //      self-healing against future async widgets. Both paths now run
  //      pre-paint (path 1 as a layout effect, this one via ResizeObserver's
  //      own pre-paint delivery in the same rendering opportunity as the
  //      resize), so neither is "ahead" of the other in the sense that used
  //      to matter; ResizeObserver still earns its keep as a separate path
  //      because it fires on box-size changes path 1's dependency list
  //      can't see (see above). Assigning `scrollTop` does not change
  //      either observed element's size, so the pin can't feed back into
  //      its own observer; the resulting scroll event just re-confirms
  //      `nearBottomRef` as true. Mount-scoped (`[]`) is correct —
  //      `RunPanelBody` doesn't remount on task switch, so both refs stay
  //      attached to the same DOM nodes across tasks and a fresh
  //      `observe()` isn't needed per task.
  //
  //      Two additional guards keep path 2 from hijacking a user-initiated
  //      resize (e.g. expanding/collapsing a "Show more" toggle while
  //      parked near the bottom):
  //        - `pinSuppressUntilRef`, armed for a short window by any
  //          pointerdown inside the log (see `onPointerDownCapture` below),
  //          skips the pin entirely so it doesn't fight a deliberate toggle
  //          or the `pendingAdjustRef` scroll compensation in
  //          `UserMessageBlock`.
  //        - `prevDist`, the distance-from-bottom computed from box sizes
  //          tracked across deliveries, re-checks bottom-proximity against
  //          the pre-resize layout rather than trusting `nearBottomRef`
  //          alone — that ref is latched by scroll events, which WebKit can
  //          throttle during momentum scrolling, so it can still read stale
  //          `true` mid-fling. `el.scrollTop` read synchronously is always
  //          current even when scroll events lag, so the pre-resize

 *     prompt is self-contained, not an ongoing conversation to resume.
 *   - Non-pipeline, api-error/session-died: the agent just needs a nudge to
 *     continue — `onRetryNudge` resumes the existing session (works for
 *     every agent kind: task.runId is never cleared on a block, so the
 *     panel's `resumableRunId` already resolves to it regardless of harness).
 *   - Non-pipeline, unknown-command: resending the identical text would
 *     likely fail the same way (that's why it failed) — `onEditAndRetry`
