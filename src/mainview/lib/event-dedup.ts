/**
 * Composite dedup key for a stream event.
 *
 * `user` events drop `ts` (the live + JSONL copies carry different
 * timestamps) and normalize newlines, keying on `user|runId|first-200-chars`
 * so the two paths collapse to one bubble. Everything else keeps `ts` because
 * the polling fallback in claude-tmux flushes many JSONL events per tick, all
 * stamped with the same `Date.now()` ms — `ts` is what keeps genuinely
 * distinct same-tick events apart.
 *
 * A slash-command send produces a live echo ("/implement args…") the instant
 * it's submitted, and a JSONL twin — claude CLI's `<command-name>`/
 * `<command-args>` XML expansion of that same send — whose text differs
 * byte-for-byte from the echo. `canonicalizeUserText` reduces the XML shape
 * back to the plain echo shape before the key is sliced, so the existing
 * 200-char key collapses the two into one bubble instead of two.
 *
 * An image-attached send has the same live-echo/JSONL-twin split for a
 * different reason: claude's TUI rewrites its OWN transcript copy of the
 * send, prepending a `[Image #N]` placeholder and blanking the image path
 * out of the trailing "Referenced files/folders:" bullet, while the live
 * echo agetor emits keeps the original text and the real path in the bullet.
 * `canonicalizeAttachmentText` strips both differences (the placeholder
 * token, and the now-bare/image bullet) from whichever copy is being keyed,
 * so the live echo and the JSONL twin of the same image-attached send
 * reduce to one identical string and collapse to a single bubble too.
 *
 * A pasted send has a third split: claude wraps a bracketed paste in
 * `<pasted_content id="…">` (behind agetor's own typed lead-in line), and
 * `trim()`s the pasted body while doing so. `canonicalizeUserText` strips the
 * lead-in + wrapper; the key is additionally `trim()`med on BOTH copies so an
 * echo that kept boundary whitespace (`agetor send`, a backlog item, an
 * ask-card free-text answer — none of which trim like the dock composer does)
 * still meets its trimmed twin. Symmetric, and keys never leave memory.
 *
 * Consequence of the ts-less `user` key: two genuinely-identical user sends in
 * the SAME run (e.g. folding `"continue"` twice into one in-flight turn) share
 * a key and render as a single bubble — and, since the key is `trim()`med,
 * so do two sends that differ only in boundary whitespace (`"ok"` then
 * `"ok\n"`). This is intentional — there is no
 * disambiguator that survives the live-echo↔JSONL-twin collapse — and harmless:
 * both sends are still delivered to claude (the tmux paste is independent of UI
 * dedup). Distinct runs get distinct keys via `runId`, so repeated idle
 * follow-ups still each show.

 *    evicted) so a multi-thousand-event turn can't grow the set unbounded.
 *
 *  - `durable` — `user` events ONLY. A user message's two copies (live echo +
 *    JSONL twin) can be separated by thousands of intervening events: when a
 *    follow-up is folded into an in-flight turn on a long-running task, the live
 *    echo lands immediately but claude doesn't transcribe the JSONL twin until
 *    it finishes the current (long) response. If the live echo's key lived in
 *    the evictable `volatile` set it would be gone by the time the twin arrives,
 *    and the twin would render as a duplicate bubble — the exact "duplicated
 *    user message on long-running tasks" bug. So `user` keys get their own set,
 *    trimmed only at a far higher threshold (`userCap`). Crucially the fold gap
 *    is measured in *volatile* events, not user messages, so eviction here only
 *    ever drops user keys old enough that their twin landed long ago — the
 *    high cap is pure belt-and-suspenders against an unbounded session, not
 *    load-bearing for correctness. User events are rare (one per turn), so the
 *    default cap is reached only by genuinely enormous conversations.
