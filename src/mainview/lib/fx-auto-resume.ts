// live `m:ss` text both `TaskCard`'s `fx-paused-badge` and `RunPanel`'s
// `PausedRecoveryNotice` render. The formatting itself
// (`fxAutoResumeCountdownText`) stays in `src/shared/fx-recovery.ts` so
// bun-side code (CLI/TUI) can reuse it with no React dependency; this file
// is the one place the webview turns that pure formatter into a ticking
// value plus the two label strings the card badge needs.

 * schedule, a cleared one, or a fired-and-rescheduled one), so a card or
 * notice with no pending auto-resume never runs a timer.

 * (`rec.autoResumeStopped`). `FX_AUTO_RESUME_MAX` (not `rec.autoResume?.max`)
 * backs the "gave up" wording because by the time a chain reads
 * `"exhausted"`, `autoResume` itself has already gone back to `null` — the
 * cap that was hit is a constant, not per-row state. `"failed"` — a timer
 * fired but the resume it tried to start couldn't (see
 * `TaskFxRecovery.autoResumeStopped`'s doc) — is reported distinctly from
 * `"cancelled"` so the tooltip never claims the user cancelled something
 * that actually tried and failed to start. When neither a pending timer
 * nor a stopped reason is recorded (e.g. the row was just written and the
 * orchestrator's scheduling decision hasn't landed yet), the suffix falls
 * back to a generic pointer at the task panel.
