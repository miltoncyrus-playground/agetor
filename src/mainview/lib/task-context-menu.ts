 * returned `action` to its real handler and renders the entries.
 *
 * Gating mirrors `TaskCard`'s own button precedence exactly (see the
 * "Button precedence: Answer > Stop > Open > Run" comment in TaskCard.tsx)
 * so the menu never offers an action the card's own hover buttons wouldn't:
 * `awaiting`/`active`/`openable` are computed the same way, and "Run" is
 * hidden whenever the card would instead show "Answer"/"Review"/"Stop"/
 * "Open" — re-running from the menu while a turn is live or unread output
 * is waiting would be surprising, not a shortcut.
 *
 * `ctx.isOpen` mirrors `TaskCard`'s `isOpen` prop (`task.id ===
 * selected?.id`): the read/unread entries are suppressed while the run
 * panel for this task is already open, matching the card's own dot
 * suppression (messages streamed while open are marked seen on close, not
 * mid-session).
