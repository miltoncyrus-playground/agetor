// Pure search-over-events logic for the task-details message stream
// (RunPanel). Kept DOM-free (like subagent-tabs.ts / shared/user-message.ts) so
// the matching/navigation math can be unit-tested without a DOM harness —
// this repo has no jsdom/testing-library, so anything that touches the log's
// actual React tree has to be validated by testing the logic it's driven by
// instead. `findMatchingEventIds` uses each event's position in the array
// RunPanel hands it (`displayedEvents`, in `RunEvent` order) as the match id
// — the server doesn't guarantee a stable id across every source an event
// can come from (live SSE vs. a JSONL rebuild splice — see `StreamEvent` in
// RunPanel.tsx), but a positional index scoped to "whatever's currently
// displayed" is always available, and it's exactly what the log's
// `data-evid` DOM attribute is keyed on too.
