/**
 * E2E coverage for `docs/plans/fx-model-catalog-refresh.md` TT1: the fx model
 * picker must show the signed-in account's discovered catalog (curated ∩
 * discovered, plus discovered-only ids) rather than the full static curated
 * list, must populate live without a page reload (the boot-race D4/D5 close),
 * and its manual ↻ must work — across all three surfaces that render a model
 * picker for fx (New Task form, task-details inline editor). CLI parity
 * (`agetor add`, T8) is out of scope here — no Playwright coverage of the CLI.
 *
 * The account catalog is stood in by `e2e/fixtures.ts`'s fx stub binary,
 * which now answers `fx models --json` with a small fixed 3-id catalog:
 * `zai/glm-5.3-flash` and `openai/gpt-5.2` (both curated rows, proving the
 * curated ∩ discovered intersection) plus `e2e/discovered-only` (no curated
 * row, proving the discovered-only-id append). Every other curated fx id —
 * including non-catalogOnly rows like `spacexai/grok-4.6` /
 * `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` and every `catalogOnly` premium row — is
 * absent from that 3-id catalog, so `mergeModelOptions`'s scoped branch
 * (`src/shared/model-options.ts`) filters them all out. This is the exact
 * merged list every test below polls for.
 *
 * fx ships disabled by default (migration 046), so the first test enables it
 * — and does so from *inside* the test, immediately before navigating,
 * rather than in a `beforeAll` — because proving "populates without a
 * reload" requires the harness to go from disabled to enabled with no
 * `page.reload()` anywhere in that test's body. The remaining tests reuse
 * the now-enabled harness (this file runs `mode: "serial"`, and `backend` is
 * worker-scoped — same pattern as e2e/fx-interactions.spec.ts).
