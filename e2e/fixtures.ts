/**
 * fx's availability probe (`checkHarness` in src/bun/agent-status.ts) is a
 * DUAL probe — `--version` (generic, same as every other harness) AND
 * `--help`, whose output must contain "coding agent" — because the bare
 * name `fx` collides with an unrelated npm JSON-viewer CLI, and `--version`
 * alone can't tell them apart. That probe runs regardless of
 * `AGETOR_FX_DRIVER=fake` (the driver override only replaces `spawnAgent`'s
 * fx branch, not the separate start-task pre-flight), so a bare `/bin/echo`
 * — good enough for claude's probe below — would fail fx's `--help` check
 * and `startTask` would reject every fx run before the fake driver ever ran.
 * This stub script mirrors the one `src/bun/orchestrator-fx.test.ts` writes
 * for the identical reason.
 *
 * Written inside the given `dataDir` (a subdirectory, so it can't collide
 * with anything `headless.ts` itself creates there) rather than at its own
 * module-scope temp dir — `dataDir` is already `rm -rf`'d by
 * `provisionBackend`'s teardown (both the success and pre-health-check
 * failure paths), so the stub is cleaned up for free instead of leaking a
 * bare `mkdtempSync` directory per importing process for the lifetime of the
 * machine. Callers must invoke this after `dataDir` exists but before
 * spawning the backend, since `AGETOR_FX_BIN` must already point at an
 * executable file by the time `headless.ts` starts probing it.
 *
 * Also answers `fx models --json` (`src/bun/agent-discovery.ts`'s
 * `discoverFx`, added by `docs/plans/fx-model-catalog-refresh.md`), which
 * every enabled fx harness gets probed with — at boot, on enable, on manual
 * ↻, and periodically. Without a real answer here that probe would resolve
 * to an empty catalog (a malformed/non-JSON response degrades to `[]`,
 * never a throw — see `parseFxModels`), which would make every fx-model-
 * picker e2e assertion trivially true against an empty list instead of
 * proving the account-scoped merge (`mergeModelOptions`,
 * curated ∩ discovered + discovered-only) actually happened. The three ids
 * below are deliberately a small, fixed catalog independent of the real
 * fx.sh Gateway catalog: two overlap curated `AGENT_OPTIONS.fx.models` rows
 * (`zai/glm-5.3-flash` — the curated default — and `openai/gpt-5.2`) to
 * exercise the "curated ∩ discovered" intersection, and one
 * (`e2e/discovered-only`) has no curated row at all, to exercise the
 * discovered-only-id append path. Deliberately still NOT implementing
 * `status --json` — that keeps the pre-flight auth check failing OPEN
 * (`loggedIn: null`) against this stub, exactly as documented above and in
 * CLAUDE.md's fx bullet, so no e2e spec (this file's callers included) is
 * ever blocked by the auth pre-flight.
